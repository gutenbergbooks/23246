<h3><i>In Which Things Are Said of Diogenes and of a
Lady With a Lantern.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> second day of the New Year came on Saturday.
The holiday atmosphere had thus been
extended over the week-end. The Christmas wreaths
still hung in the windows, and there had been an
added day of feasting. Holidays always brought
people from town who ate with sharp appetites.</p>

<p>It was mostly men who came, men who fished and
men who hunted. In the long low house by the
river one found good meals and good beds, warm
fires in winter and a wide porch in summer. There
were few luxuries, but it pleased certain wise Old
Gentlemen to take their sport simply, and to take
pride in the simplicity. They considered the magnificence
of modern camps and clubs vulgar, and as
savoring somewhat of riches newly acquired; and
they experienced an almost &aelig;sthetic satisfaction in
the contrast between the rough cleanliness of certain
little lodges along the Chesapeake and its tributary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>[<a href="./images/12.png">12</a>]</span>
tide-water streams, and the elegance of the Charles
Street mansions which they had, for the moment, left
behind.</p>

<p>It was these Old Gentlemen who, in khaki and
tweed, each in its proper season, came to Peter
Bower's, and ate the food which Peter's wife cooked
for them. They went out in the morning fresh and
radiant, and returned at night, tired but still radiant,
to sit by the fire or on the porch, and, in jovial
content, to tell of the delights of earlier days and of
what sport had been before the invasion of the
Philistines.</p>

<p>They knew much of gastronomic lore, these Old
Gentlemen, and they liked to talk of things to eat.
But they spoke of other things, and now and then
they fell into soft silences when a sunset was upon
them or a night of stars.</p>

<p>And they could tell stories! Stories backed by
sparkling wit and a nice sense of discrimination.
On winter nights or on holiday afternoons like this,
as, gathered around the fire they grew mildly convivial,
the sound of their laughter would rise to Anne
Warfield's room under the eaves; she would push
back the papers which held her to her desk, and
wish with a sigh that the laughter were that of young
men, and that she might be among them.</p>

<p>To-day, however, she was not at her desk. She
was taking down the decorations which had made
the little room bright during the brief holiday. To-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>[<a href="./images/13.png">13</a>]</span>morrow
she would go back to school and to the
forty children whom she taught. Life would again
stretch out before her, dull and uneventful. The
New Year would hold for her no meaning that the
old year had not held.</p>

<p>It had snowed all of the night before, and from
her window she could see the river, slate-gray against
the whiteness. Out-of-doors it was very cold, but
her own room was hot with the heat of the little
round stove. With her holly wreaths in her arms,
she stood uncertain in front of it. She had thought
to burn the holly, but it had seemed to her, all at
once, that to end thus the vividness of berry and of
leaf would be desecration. Surely they deserved to
die out in that clear cold world in which they had
been born and bred!</p>

<p>It was a fanciful thought, but she yielded to it.
Besides, there was Diogenes! She must make sure
of his warmth and comfort before night closed in.</p>

<p>She put on her red scarf and cap and, with the
wreaths in her arms, she went down-stairs. The Old
Gentlemen were in the front room and she had to
pass through. They rose to a man. She liked the
courtliness, and gave in return her lovely smile and
a little bow.</p>

<p>They gazed after her with frank admiration.
"Who is she?" asked one who was not old, and
who, slim and dark and with a black ribbon for his
eye-glasses, seemed a stranger in this circle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>[<a href="./images/14.png">14</a>]</span>
"The new teacher of the Crossroads school.
There wasn't any place for her to board but this.
So they took her in."</p>

<p>"Pretty girl."</p>

<p>The Old Gentlemen agreed, but they did not discuss
her charms at length. They belonged to a
generation which preferred not to speak in a crowd
of a woman's attractions. One of them remarked,
however, that he envied her the good fortune of
feasting all the year round at Peter Bower's table.</p>

<p>Anne, trudging through the snow with the wreaths
in her arms, would have laughed mockingly if she
had heard them. It was not food that she wanted,
not the game and oysters and fish over which these
old gourmands gloated. What she wanted was the
nectar and ambrosia of life, the color and glow&mdash;the
companionship of young things like herself!</p>

<p>Of course there were the school children and there
was Peggy. But to the children and Peggy she was
a grown-up creature. Loving her, they still made
her feel age's immeasurable distance, as she had felt
her own distance from the Old Gentlemen.</p>

<p>It was Peggy, who, wound in her mother's knitted
white shawl until she looked like a dingy snowball,
bounced from the kitchen to meet her.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" she asked.</p>

<p>The young teacher laughed. "Peggy," she said,
"if you will never tell, you may come with me."</p>

<p>"Where?" demanded Peggy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>[<a href="./images/15.png">15</a>]</span>
"Across the road and into the woods and down to
the river."</p>

<p>"What are you carrying the wreaths for?"</p>

<p>"Wait and see."</p>

<p>The road which they crossed was the railroad.
Over the iron rails the trains thundered from one
big city to another, with a river to cross just before
they reached Peter Bower's. Very few of the trains
stopped at Peter's, and it was this neglect of theirs,
and the consequent isolation, which constituted the
charm of Bower's for town-tired folk. Yet Anne
Warfield always wished that some palatial express
might tarry for a moment to take her aboard, and
whirl her on to the world of flashing lights, of sky-scraping
towers and streaming crowds.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with the wreaths?"
Peggy was still demanding as they entered upon
the frozen silence of the pine woods.</p>

<p>"I am going down as close as I can to the water's
edge, and I am going to fling them out as far as I
can into the river. And perhaps the river will carry
them down to the sea, and the sea will say, 'Whence
came you?' and the wreaths will whisper, 'We came
from the forest to die on your breast, the river
brought us, and the winds sang to us, and above us
the sky smiled. And now we are ready to die, for
we have seen life and its loveliness. It would have
been dreadful if we had come to our end in the ashes
of a little round stove.'"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>[<a href="./images/16.png">16</a>]</span>
Peggy stared, open-eyed. She had missed the
application, but she liked the story.</p>

<p>"Let me throw one of them," she said.</p>

<p>"You couldn't throw them far enough, dear heart.
But you shall count, 'one, two, three' for me. And
when you say 'three' I'll throw one of them away,
and then you must count again, and I will throw the
others."</p>

<p>So Peggy, quite entranced by the importance of
her office, took her part in the ceremony, and Anne
Warfield stood on top of the snowy bank above the
river, and cast upon its tumbling surface the bright
burden which it was to carry to the sea.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that there crossed the bridge
the only train from the north which stopped by day
at Peter Bower's. The passengers looking out saw,
far below them, sullen stream, somber woods, and a
girl in a gay red scarf. They saw, too, a dingy
white dot of a child who danced up and down.
When the train stopped a few minutes later at
Bower's, six of the passengers stepped from it, three
men and three women, a smartly-dressed, cosmopolitan
group, quite evidently indifferent to the
glances which followed them.</p>

<p>Anne and Peggy had no eyes for the new arrivals.
If they noticed the train at all, it was merely to give
it a slurring thought, as bringing more Old Gentlemen
who would eat and be merry, then hurry back
again to town. As for themselves, having finished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>[<a href="./images/17.png">17</a>]</span>
the business of the moment, they had yet to look
after Diogenes.</p>

<p>Diogenes was a drake. He lived a somewhat
cloistered life in the stable which had been made
over into a garage. He had wandered in one morning
soon after Anne had come to teach in the school.
Peter had suggested that he be killed and eaten.
But Anne, lonely in her new quarters, had appreciated
the forlornness of the old drake and had adopted him.
She had named him Diogenes because he had an air
of searching always for something which could not
be found. Once when a flock of wild ducks had
flown overhead, Diogenes had listened, and, as their
faint cries had come down to him, he had stretched
his wings as if he, too, would fly. But his fat body
had held him, and so still chained to earth, he
waddled within the limits of his narrow domain.</p>

<p>In a cozy corner of the garage there was plenty
of straw and a blanket to keep off draughts. Mrs.
Bower had declared such luxury unsettling. But
Anne had laughed at her. "Why should pleasant
things hurt us?" she had asked, and Mrs. Bower
had shaken her head.</p>

<p>"If you had seen the old men who come here and
stuff, and die because their livers are wrong, you'd
know what I mean. Give him enough, but don't
pamper him."</p>

<p>In the face of this warning, however, Anne fed the
old drake on tidbits, and visited him at least once a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>[<a href="./images/18.png">18</a>]</span>
day. He returned her favors by waiting for her at
the gate when it was not too cold and, preceding
her to the house, gave a sort of major-domo effect
to her progress.</p>

<p>Entering the stable, they found a lantern lighting
the gloom, and Diogenes in a state of agitation.
His solitude had been invaded by an Irish setter&mdash;a
lovely auburn-coated creature with melting eyes, who,
held by a leash, lay at length on Diogenes' straw
with Diogenes' blanket keeping off the cold.</p>

<p>The old drake from some remote fastness flung
his protest to the four winds!</p>

<p>"He's a new one." Peggy patted the dog, who
rose to welcome them. "He ought to be in the
kennels. Somebody didn't know."</p>

<p>Somebody probably had not known, but had
learned. For now the door opened, and a young
man came in. He was a big young man with fair
hair, and he had arrived on the train.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said, as he saw them, "but
they told me I had put my dog in the wrong place."</p>

<p>Peggy was important. "He belongs at the kennels.
He's in Diogenes' corner."</p>

<p>"Diogenes?"</p>

<p>The old drake, reassured by the sound of voices,
showed himself for a moment in the track of the
lantern light.</p>

<p>"There he is," Peggy said, excitedly; "he lives in
here by himself."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>[<a href="./images/19.png">19</a>]</span>
Anne had not spoken, but as she lifted the lantern
from its nail and held it high, Richard Brooks was
aware that this was the same girl whom he had
glimpsed from the train. He had noted then her
slenderness of outline, the grace and freedom of her
pose; at closer range he saw her delicate smallness;
the bloom on her cheek; the dusky softness of her
hair; the length of her lashes; the sapphire deeps
of her eyes. Yet it was not these charms which arrested
his attention; it was, rather, a certain swift
thought of her as superior to her surroundings.</p>

<p>"Then it is Diogenes whose pardon I must beg,"
he said, his eyes twinkling as the old drake took
refuge behind Anne's skirts. "Toby, come out of
that. It's you for a cold kennel."</p>

<p>"It's not cold in the kennels," Peggy protested; "it
is nice and warm, and the food is fixed by Eric Brand."</p>

<p>"And where can I find Eric Brand?"</p>

<p>"He isn't here." It was Anne who answered him.
"He is away for the New Year. Peggy and I have
been looking after the dogs."</p>

<p>She did not tell him that she had done it because
she liked dogs, and not because it was a part of her
day's work. And he did not know that she taught
school. Hence, as he walked beside her toward the
kennels, with Peggy dancing on ahead with Toby,
and with Diogenes left behind in full possession, he
thought of her, quite naturally, as the daughter of
Peter Bower.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>[<a href="./images/20.png">20</a>]</span>
It was an uproarious pack which greeted them.
Every Old Gentleman owned a dog, and there was
Peter's Mamie, two or three eager-eyed pointers,
setters, hounds and Chesapeake Bay dogs. Old
Mamie was nondescript, and was shut up in the
kennels to-night only because Eric was away. She
was eminently trustworthy, and usually ran at large.</p>

<p>Toby, given a box to himself, turned his melting
eyes upon his master and whined.</p>

<p>"He was sent to me just before I left New York,"
Richard explained. "I fancy he is rather homesick.
I am the only thing in sight that he knows."</p>

<p>"You might take him into the house," Anne said
doubtfully, "only it is a rule that if there are many
dogs they all have to share alike and stay out here.
When there are only two or three they go into the
sitting-room with the men."</p>

<p>"He can lie down behind the stove in the kitchen,"
Peggy offered hospitably. "Mamie does."</p>

<p>Richard shook his head. "Toby will have to
learn with the rest of us that life isn't always what
we want it to be."</p>

<p>He was startled by the look which the girl with the
lantern gave him. "Why shouldn't it be as we
want it?" she said, with sudden fire; "if I were
Providence, I'd make things pleasant, and you are
playing Providence to Toby. Why not let him
have the comfort of the kitchen stove?"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3><i>In Which a Princess Serving Finds That the Motto
of Kings is Meaningless.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Toby</span>, safe and snug behind the kitchen stove,
was keenly alive to the fact that supper was
being served. He had had his own supper, so that
his interest was purely impersonal.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bower cooked, and her daughter Beulah
waited on the table. The service was not elaborate.
Everything went in at once, and Peter helped the
women carry the loaded trays.</p>

<p>Anne Warfield ate usually with the family. She
would have liked to sit with the Old Gentlemen at
their genial gatherings, but it would not, she felt,
have been sanctioned by the Bowers. Their own
daughter, Beulah, would not have done it. Beulah
had nothing in common with the jovial hunters and
fishers. She had her own circle of companions, her
own small concerns, her own convictions as to the
frivolity of these elderly guests. She would not
have cared to listen to what they had to say. She
did not know that their travels, their adventures,
their stored-up experience had made them rich in
anecdote, ready of tongue to tell of wonders un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>[<a href="./images/22.png">22</a>]</span>dreamed
of in the dullness of her own monotonous
days.</p>

<p>But Anne Warfield knew. Now and then from the
threshold she had caught the drift of their discourse,
and she had yearned to draw closer, to sail with
them on unknown seas of romance and of reminiscence,
to leave behind her for the moment the atmosphere
of schoolhouse, of small gossip, of trivial
circumstance.</p>

<p>It was with this feeling strong upon her that to-night,
when the supper bell rang, she came into the
kitchen and asked Mrs. Bower if she might help
Beulah. She had no feeling that such labor was beneath
her. If a princess cared to serve, she was
none the less a princess!</p>

<p>Secure, therefore, in her sense of unassailable dignity,
she entered the dining-room. She might have
been a goddess chained to menial tasks&mdash;a small
and vivid goddess, with dusky hair. Richard
Brooks, observing her, had once more a swift and
certain sense of her fineness and of her unlikeness to
those about her.</p>

<p>The young man with the black ribbon on his eye-glass
also observed her. Later he said to Mrs.
Bower, "Can you give me a room here for a
month?"</p>

<p>"I might. Usually people don't care to stay so
long at this time of year."</p>

<p>"I am writing a book. I want to stay."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>[<a href="./images/23.png">23</a>]</span>
Beside Richard Brooks at the table sat Evelyn
Chesley. With the Dutton-Ames, and Philip Meade,
she had come down with Richard and his mother to
speed them upon their mad adventure.</p>

<p>Evelyn had taken off her hat. Her wonderful hair
was swept up in a new fashion from her forehead, a
dull gold comb against its native gold. She wore a
silken blouse of white, slightly open at the neck.
On her fingers diamonds sparkled. It seemed to
Anne, serving, as if the air of the long low room were
charged with some thrilling quality. Here were
youth and beauty, wit and light laughter, the perfume
of the roses which Evelyn wore tucked in her
belt. There was the color, too, of the roses, and of
the cloak in which Winifred Ames had wrapped her
shivering fairness. The cloak was blue, a marvelous
pure shade like the Madonna blue of some old
picture.</p>

<p>Even Richard's mother seemed illumined by the
radiance which enveloped the rest. She was a slender
little thing and wore plain and simple widow's
black. Yet her delicate cheeks were flushed, her
eyes were shining, and her son had made her, too,
wear a red rose.</p>

<p>The supper was suited to the tastes of the old
epicures for whom it had been planned. There were
oysters and ducks with the juices following the
knife, hot breads, wild grape jelly, hominy and
celery.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>[<a href="./images/24.png">24</a>]</span>
The fattest Old Gentleman carved the ducks.
The people who had come on the train were evidently
his friends. Indeed, he called the little lady
with the shining eyes "Cousin Nancy."</p>

<p>"So you've brought your boy back?" he said,
smiling down at her.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes. Cousin Brin, I feel as if I had
reached the promised land."</p>

<p>"You'll find things changed. Nothing as it was
in your father's time. Foreigners to the right of
you, foreigners to the left. Italians, Greeks&mdash;barbarians&mdash;cutting
the old place into little farms&mdash;blotting
out the old landmarks."</p>

<p>"I don't care; the house still stands, and Richard
will hang out my father's sign, and when people
want a doctor, they will come again to Crossroads."</p>

<p>"People in these days go to town for their
doctors."</p>

<p>Richard's head went up. "I'll make them come
to me, sir. And you mustn't think that mother
brought me back. I came because I wanted to
come. I hate New York."</p>

<p>The listening Old Gentlemen, whose allegiance
was given to a staid and stately town on the
Patapsco, quite glowed at that, but Evelyn flamed:</p>

<p>"You might have made a million in New York,
Richard."</p>

<p>"I don't want a million."</p>

<p>"Oh," she appealed to Brinsley Tyson, "what can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>[<a href="./images/25.png">25</a>]</span>
you do with a man like that&mdash;without red blood&mdash;without
ambition?"</p>

<p>And now it was Richard who flamed. "I am ambitious
enough, Eve, but it isn't to make money."</p>

<p>"He has some idea," the girl proclaimed recklessly
to the whole table, "of living as his ancestors
lived; as if one <i>could</i>. He believes that people
should go back to plain manners and to strict
morals. His mission is to keep this mad world
sane."</p>

<p>A ripple of laughter greeted her scorn. Her own
laughter met it. The slim young man at the other
end of the table swung his eye-glasses from their
black ribbon negligently, but his eyes missed
nothing.</p>

<p>"It is my only grievance against you, Mrs.
Nancy," Eve told the little shining lady. "I love
you for everything else, but not for this."</p>

<p>"I am sorry, my dear. But Richard and I think
alike. So we are going to settle at Crossroads&mdash;and
live happy ever after."</p>

<p>Anne Warfield, outwardly calm, felt the blood
racing in her veins. The old house at Crossroads
was just across the way from her little school. She
had walked in the garden every day, and now and
then she had taken the children there. They had
watched the squirrels getting ready for the winter,
and had fed the belated birds with crumbs from the
little lunch baskets. And there had been the old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>[<a href="./images/26.png">26</a>]</span>
sun-dial to mark the hour when the recess ended
and to warn them that work must begin.</p>

<p>She had a rapturous vision of what it might be to
have the old house open, and to see Nancy Brooks
and her son Richard coming in and out.</p>

<p>Later, however, alone in her dull room, stripped
of its holiday trappings, the vision faded. To
Nancy and Richard she would be just the school-teacher
across the way, as to-night she had been the
girl who waited on the table!</p>

<p>There was music down-stairs. The whine of the
phonograph came up to her.</p>

<p>Peggy, knocking, brought an interesting bulletin.</p>

<p>"They are dancing," she said. "Let's sit on the
stairs and look."</p>

<p>From the top of the stairs they could see straight
into the long front room. The hall was dimly
lighted so that they were themselves free from observation.
Philip Meade and Eve were dancing, and
the Dutton-Ames. Eve had on very high shoes with
very high heels. Her skirt was wide and flaring.
She dipped and swayed and floated, and the grace
of the man with whom she danced matched her own.</p>

<p>"Isn't it lovely," said Peggy's little voice, "isn't
it lovely, Anne?"</p>

<p>It was lovely, lovely as a dream. It was a sort of
ecstasy of motion. It was youth and joy incarnate.
Anne had a wild moment of rebellion. Why must
she sit always at the head of the stairs?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>[<a href="./images/27.png">27</a>]</span>
The music stopped. Eve and Philip became one
of the circle around the fireplace in the front room.
Again Eve's roses and Winifred's cloak gave color
to the group. There was also the leaping golden
flame of the fire, and, in the background, a slight
blue haze where some of the Old Gentlemen smoked.</p>

<p>The young man with the eye-glasses was telling
a story. He told it well, and there was much
laughter when he finished. When the music began
again, he danced with Winifred Ames. Dutton
Ames watched them, smiling. He always smiled
when his eyes rested on his lovely wife.</p>

<p>Evelyn danced with Richard. He did not dance as
well as Philip, but he gave the effect of doing it
easily. He swung her finally out into the hall. The
whine of the phonograph ceased. Richard and Eve
sat down on a lower step of the stairway.</p>

<p>The girl's voice came up to the quiet watchers
clearly. "When are you coming to New York to
dance with me again, Dicky Boy?"</p>

<p>"You must come down here. Pip will bring you
in his car for the week-ends, with the Dutton-Ames.
And I'll get a music box and a lot of new records.
The old dining-room has a wonderful floor."</p>

<p>"I hate your wonderful floor and your horrid old
house. And when I think of Fifth Avenue and the
lights and the theaters and you away from it
all&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Poor young doctors have no right to the lights<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>[<a href="./images/28.png">28</a>]</span>
and all the rest of it. Eve, don't let's quarrel at the
last moment. You'll be reconciled to it all some
day."</p>

<p>"I shall never be reconciled."</p>

<p>And now Philip Meade was claiming her. "You
promised me this, Eve."</p>

<p>"I shall have all the rest of the winter for you,
Pip."</p>

<p>"As if that made any difference! I never put off
till to-morrow the things I want to do to-day. And
as for Richard, he'll come running back to us before
the winter is over."</p>

<p>Richard shrugged. "You're a pair of cheerful
prophets. Go and fox-trot with him, Eve."</p>

<p>Left alone, the eyes of the young doctor went at
once to the top of the stairs.</p>

<p>"Come down and dance," he said.</p>

<p>"Do you mean me?" Peggy demanded out of the
dimness.</p>

<p>"I mean both of you."</p>

<p>"I can't dance&mdash;not the new dances." Anne was
conscious of an overwhelming shyness. "Take
Peggy."</p>

<p>"How did you know we were up here?" Peggy
asked.</p>

<p>"Well, I heard a little laugh, and a little whisper,
and I looked up and saw a little girl."</p>

<p>"Oh, oh, did you really?"</p>

<p>"Really."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>[<a href="./images/29.png">29</a>]</span>
"Well, I can't dance. But I can try."</p>

<p>So they tried, with Richard lifting the child lightly
to the lilting tune.</p>

<p>When he brought her back, he sat down beside
Anne. Shyness still chained her, but he chatted easily.
Anne could not have told why she was shy. In
the stable she had felt at her ease with him. But
then she had not seen Eve or Winifred. It was the
women who had seemed to make the difference.</p>

<p>Presently, however, he had her telling of her
school. "It begins again to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Do you like it?"</p>

<p>"Teaching? No. But I love the children."</p>

<p>"Do you teach Peggy?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She is too young, really, but she insists
upon going."</p>

<p>"There used to be a schoolhouse across the road
from my grandfather's. A red brick school with a
bell on top."</p>

<p>"There is still a bell. I always ring it myself, although
the boys beg to do it. But I like to think of
myself as the bell ringer."</p>

<p>It was while they sat there that Eric Brand came
in through the kitchen-way to the hall. He stood
for a moment looking into the lighted front room
where Eve still danced with Philip Meade, and where
the young man with the eye-glasses talked with the
Dutton-Ames. Anne instinctively kept silent. It
was Peggy who revealed their hiding place to him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>[<a href="./images/30.png">30</a>]</span>
"Oh, Eric," she piped, "are you back?" She
went flying down the stairs to him.</p>

<p>He caught her, and holding her in his arms, peered
up. "Who's there?"</p>

<p>Peggy answered. "It's Anne and the new doctor.
I danced with him, and he came on the train with
those other people in there&mdash;and he has a dog named
Toby&mdash;it's in the kitchen."</p>

<p>"So that's his dog? It will have to go to the
kennels for the night."</p>

<p>Richard, descending, apologized. "I shouldn't
have let Toby stay in the house, but Miss Bower put
in a plea for him."</p>

<p>"Beulah?"</p>

<p>"He means Anne," Peggy explained. "Her name
is Warfield. It's funny you didn't know."</p>

<p>"How could I?" Richard had a feeling that he
owed the little goddess-girl an explanation of his
stupidity. He found himself again ascending the
stairs.</p>

<p>But Anne had fled. Overwhelmingly she realized
that Richard had believed her to be the daughter of
Peter Bower. Daughter of that crude and common
man! Sister of Beulah! Friend of Eric
Brand!</p>

<p>Well, she had brought it on herself. She had
looked after the dogs and she had waited on the
table. People thought differently of these things.
The ideals she had tried to teach her children were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>[<a href="./images/31.png">31</a>]</span>
not the ideals of the larger world. Labor did not
dignify itself. The motto of kings was meaningless!
A princess serving was no longer a princess!</p>

<p>Sitting very tense and still in the little rocking-chair
in her own room, she decided that of course
Richard looked down on her. He had perceived in
her no common ground of birth or of breeding. Yet
her grandfather had been the friend of the grandfather
of Richard Brooks!</p>

<p>When Peggy came up, she announced that she
was to sleep with Anne. It was an arrangement often
made when the house was full. To-night Anne welcomed
the cheery presence of the child. She sang
her to sleep, and then sat for a long time by the little
round stove with Peggy in her arms.</p>

<p>She laid her down as a knock sounded on her
door.</p>

<p>"Are you up?" some one asked, and she opened
it, to find Evelyn Chesley.</p>

<p>"May I borrow a needle?" She showed a torn
length of lace-trimmed flounce. "I caught it on
a rocker in my room. There shouldn't be any
rocker."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bower loves them," Anne said, as she hunted
through her little basket; "she loves to rock and
rock. All the women around here do."</p>

<p>"Then you're not one of them?"</p>

<p>"No. My grandmother was Cynthia Warfield of
Carroll."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>[<a href="./images/32.png">32</a>]</span>
The name meant nothing to Evelyn. It would
have meant much to Nancy Brooks.</p>

<p>"How did you happen to come here? I don't see
how any one could choose to come."</p>

<p>"My mother died&mdash;and there was no one but my
Great-uncle Rodman Warfield. I had to get something
to do&mdash;so I came here, and Uncle Rod went
to live with a married cousin."</p>

<p>Evelyn had perched herself on the post of Anne's
bed and was mending the flounce. Although she
was not near the lamp, she gave an effect of gathering
to her all the light of the room. She was wrapped
in a robe of rose-color, a strange garment with fur
to set it off, and of enormous fullness. It spread
about her and billowed out until it almost hid the
little bed and the child upon it.</p>

<p>Beside her, Anne in her blue serge felt clumsy and
common. She knew that she ought not to feel that
way, but she did. She would have told her scholars
that it was not clothes that made the man, or dress
the woman. But then she told her scholars many
things that were right and good. She tried herself
to be as right and good as her theories. But it was
not always possible. It was not possible at this
moment.</p>

<p>"What brought you here?" Eve persisted.</p>

<p>"I teach school. I came in September."</p>

<p>"What do you teach?"</p>

<p>"Everything. We are not graded."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>[<a href="./images/33.png">33</a>]</span>
"I hope you teach them to be honest with themselves."</p>

<p>"I am not sure that I know what you mean?"</p>

<p>"Don't let them pretend to be something that
they are not. That's why so many people fail.
They reach too high, and fall. That's what Nancy
Brooks is doing to Richard. She is making him
reach too high."</p>

<p>She laughed as she bent above her needle. "I
fancy you are not interested in that. But I can't
think of anything but&mdash;the waste of it. I hope you
will all be so healthy that you won't need him, and
then he will have to come back to New York."</p>

<p>"I don't see how anybody could leave New York.
Not to come down here." Anne drew a quick breath.</p>

<p>Eve spoke carelessly: "Oh, well, I suppose it
isn't so bad here for a woman, but for a man&mdash;a
man needs big spaces. Richard will be cramped&mdash;he'll
shrink to the measure of all this&mdash;narrowness."
She had finished her flounce, and she rose and gave
Anne the needle. "In the morning, if the weather is
good, we are to ride to Crossroads. Is your school
very far away?"</p>

<p>"It is opposite Crossroads. Mrs. Brooks' father
built it."</p>

<p>Anne spoke stiffly. She had felt the sting of Eve's
indifference, and she was furious with herself for her
consciousness of Eve's clothes, of her rings&mdash;of the
gold comb in her hair.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>[<a href="./images/34.png">34</a>]</span>
When her visitor had gone, Anne took down her
own hair, and flung it up into a soft knot on the top
of her head. Swept back thus, her face seemed to
bloom into sudden beauty. She slipped the blue
dress from her shoulders and saw the long slim line
of her neck and the whiteness of her skin.</p>

<p>The fire had died down in the little round stove.
The room was cold. She thought of Eve's rose-color,
and of the warmth of her furs.</p>

<p>Bravely, however, she hummed the tune to which
the others had danced. She lifted her feet in time.
Her shoes were heavy, and she took them off. She
tried to get the rhythm, the lightness, the grace of
movement. But these things must be taught, and
she had no one to teach her.</p>

<p>When at last she crept into bed beside the sleeping
Peggy, she was chilled to the bone, and she was
crying.</p>

<p>Peggy stirred and murmured.</p>

<p>Soothing the child, Anne told herself fiercely that
she was a goose to be upset because Eve Chesley
had rings and wore rose-color. Why, she was no
better than Diogenes, who had fumed and fussed
because Toby had taken his straw in the stable.</p>

<p>But her philosophy failed to bring peace of mind.
For a long time she lay awake, working it out. At
last she decided, wearily, that she had wept because
she really didn't know any of the worth-while things.
She didn't know any of the young things and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>[<a href="./images/35.png">35</a>]</span>
gay things. She didn't know how to dance or
to talk to men like Richard Brooks. The only
things that she knew in the whole wide world were&mdash;books!</p>

<h3><i>In Which the Crown Prince Enters Upon His Own.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> developed that the name of the young man with
the eye-glasses was Geoffrey Fox. Mrs. Bower
told Anne at the breakfast table, as the two women
sat alone.</p>

<p>"He is writing a book, and he wants to stay."</p>

<p>"The little dark man?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't call him little. He is thin, but he is
as tall as Richard Brooks."</p>

<p>"Is he?" To Anne it had seemed as if Richard
had towered above her like a young giant. She had
scarcely noticed the young man with the eye-glasses.
He had melted into the background of old gentlemen;
had become, as it were, a part of a composite
instead of a single personality.</p>

<p>But to be writing a book!</p>

<p>"What kind of a book, Mrs. Bower?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. He didn't say. I am going to
give him the front room in the south wing; then he
will have a view of the river."</p>

<p>When Anne met the dark young man in the hall
an hour later, she discovered that he had keen eyes
and a mocking smile.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>[<a href="./images/37.png">37</a>]</span>
He stopped her. "Do we have to be introduced?
I am going to stay here. Did Mrs. Bower tell
you?"</p>

<p>"She told me you were writing a book."</p>

<p>"Don't tell anybody else; I'm not proud of it."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>He shrugged. "My stories are pot-boilers, most
of them&mdash;with everybody happy in the end."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't everybody be happy in the end?"</p>

<p>"Because life isn't that way."</p>

<p>"Life is what we make it."</p>

<p>"Who told you that?"</p>

<p>She flushed. "It is what I tell my school children."</p>

<p>"But have you found it so?"</p>

<p>She faltered. "No&mdash;but perhaps it is my fault."</p>

<p>"It isn't anybody's fault. If the gods smile&mdash;we
are happy. If they frown, we are miserable. That's
all there is to it."</p>

<p>"I should hate to think that was all." She was
roused and ready to fight for her ideals. "I should
hate to think it."</p>

<p>"All your hating won't make it as you want it,"
his glance was quizzical, "but we won't quarrel
about it."</p>

<p>"Of course not," stiffly.</p>

<p>"And we are to be friends? You see I am to stay
a month."</p>

<p>"Are you going to write about us?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>[<a href="./images/38.png">38</a>]</span>
"I shall write about the Old Gentlemen. Is there
always such a crowd of them?"</p>

<p>"Only on holidays and week-ends."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shall write about you&mdash;&mdash;" daringly.
"I need a little lovely heroine."</p>

<p>Her look stopped him. His face changed. "I
beg your pardon," he said quickly. "I should not
have said that."</p>

<p>"Would you have said it if I had not waited on
the table?" Her voice was tremulous. The color
that had flamed in her cheeks still dyed them. "I
thought of it last night, after I went up-stairs. I
have been trying to teach my little children in my
school that there is dignity in service, and so&mdash;I
have helped Mrs. Bower. But I felt that people did
not understand."</p>

<p>"You felt that we&mdash;thought less of you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," very low.</p>

<p>"And that I spoke as I did because I did not&mdash;respect
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I beg your pardon. Indeed, I do beg your
pardon. It was thoughtless. Will you believe that
it was only because I was thoughtless?"</p>

<p>"Yes." But her troubled eyes did not meet his.
"Perhaps I am too sensitive. Perhaps you would
have said&mdash;the same things&mdash;to Eve Chesley&mdash;if you
had just met her. But I am sure you would not have
said it in the same tone."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>[<a href="./images/39.png">39</a>]</span>
He held out his hand to her. "You'll forgive me?
Yes? And be friends?"</p>

<p>She did not seem to see his hand. "Of course I
forgive you," she said, with a girlish dignity which
sat well upon her, "and perhaps I have made too
much of it, but you see I am so much alone, and I
think so much."</p>

<p>He wanted to ask her questions, of why she was
there and of why she was alone. But something in
her manner forbade, and so they spoke of other
things until she left him.</p>

<p>Geoffrey went out later for a walk in the blinding
snow. All night it had snowed and the storm had
a blizzard quality, with the wind howling and the
drifts piling to prodigious heights. Geoffrey faced
the elements with a strength which won the respect
of Richard Brooks who, also out in it, with his
dog Toby, was battling gloriously with wind and
weather.</p>

<p>"If we can reach the shelter of the pines," he
shouted, "they'll break the force of the storm."</p>

<p>Within the wood the snow was in winding sheets
about the great trees.</p>

<p>"What giant ghosts!" Geoffrey said. "Yet in a
month or two the sap will run warm in their veins,
and the silence will be lapped by waves of sound&mdash;the
singing of birds and of little streams."</p>

<p>"I used to come here when I was a boy," Richard
told him. "There were violets under the bank, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>[<a href="./images/40.png">40</a>]</span>
I picked them and made tight bunches of them and
gave them to my mother. She was young then. I
remember that she usually wore white dresses, with
a blue sash fluttering."</p>

<p>"You lived here then?"</p>

<p>"No, we visited at my grandfather's, a mile or
two away. He used to drive us down, and he
would sit out there on the point and fish,&mdash;a grand
old figure, in his broad hat, with his fishing creel
over his shoulder. There were just two sports that
my grandfather loved, fishing and fox-hunting; but
he was a very busy doctor and couldn't ride often
to hounds. But he kept a lot of them. He would
have had a great contempt for Toby. His own dogs
were a wiry little breed."</p>

<p>"My grandfather was blind, and always in his
library. So my boyhood was different. I used to
read to him. I liked it, and I wouldn't exchange
my memories for yours, except the violets&mdash;I should
like to pick them here in the spring&mdash;perhaps I shall&mdash;I
told Mrs. Bower I would take a room for a
month or more&mdash;and since we have spoken of violets&mdash;I
may wait for their blooming."</p>

<p>He laughed, and as they turned back, "I have
found several things to keep me," he said, but he
did not name them.</p>

<p>All day Anne was aware of the presence in the
house of the young guests. She was aware of Winifred
Ames' blue cloak and of Eve's roses. She was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>[<a href="./images/41.png">41</a>]</span>
aware of Richard's big voice booming through the
hall, of Geoffrey's mocking laugh.</p>

<p>But she did not go down among them. She ate
her meals after the others had finished. She did not
wait upon the table and she did not sit upon the
stairs. In the afternoon she wrote a long letter to
her Great-uncle Rodman, and she went early to bed.</p>

<p>She was waked in the morning by the bustle of
departure. Some of the Old Gentlemen went back
by motor, others by train. Warmed by a hearty
breakfast, bundled into their big coats, they were
lighted on their way by Eric Brand.</p>

<p>It was just as the sun flashed over the horizon and
showed the whiteness of a day swept clear by the
winds of the night that the train for the north carried
off the Dutton-Ames, Philip and Eve.</p>

<p>Evelyn went protesting. "Some day you are going
to regret it, Richard."</p>

<p>"Don't croak. Wish me good luck, Eve."</p>

<p>But she would not. Yet when she stood at last
on the train steps to say "Good-bye," she had in
her hand one of the roses he had given her and
which she had worn. She touched it lightly to her
lips and tossed it to him.</p>

<p>By the time he had picked it up the train was on
its way, and Evelyn, looking back, had her last
glimpse of him standing straight and tall against
the morning sky, the rose in his hand.</p>

<p>It was eight o'clock when Eric drove Anne and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>[<a href="./images/42.png">42</a>]</span>
Peggy through the drifts to the Crossroads school.
It was nine when Geoffrey Fox came down to a late
breakfast. It was ten when Richard and his mother
and the dog Toby in a hired conveyance arrived at
the place which had once been Nancy's home.</p>

<p>Imposing, even in its shabbiness, stood the old
house, at the end of an avenue of spired cedars.</p>

<p>As they opened the door a grateful warmth met
them.</p>

<p>"David has been here," Nancy said. "Oh,
Richard, Richard, what a glorious day to begin."</p>

<p>And now there came from among the shadows a
sound which made them stop and listen. "Tick,
tock," said the great hall clock.</p>

<p>"Mother, who wound it?"</p>

<p>Nancy Brooks laughed tremulously. "Cousin
David had the key. In all these years he has never
let the old clock run down. It seemed queer to
think of it ticking away in this empty house."</p>

<p>There were tears in her eyes. He stooped and
kissed her. "And now that you are here, you are
going to be happy?"</p>

<p>"Very happy, dear boy."</p>

<p>It was nearly twelve when David Tyson came
limping up the path. He had a basket in one hand,
and a cane in the other. Behind him trotted a
weedy-looking foxhound. The dog Toby, charging
out of the door as Nancy opened it, fell, as it were,
upon the neck of the hound. His overtures of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>[<a href="./images/43.png">43</a>]</span>
friendship were met with a dignified aloofness which
merged gradually into a reluctant cordiality.</p>

<p>Nancy held out both hands to the old man. "I
saw you coming. Oh, how good it seems to be
here again, Cousin David."</p>

<p>"Let me look at you." He set the basket down,
and took her hands in his. Then he shook his
head. "New York has done things to you," he
said. "It has given you a few gray hairs. But
now that you are back again I shall try to forgive
it."</p>

<p>"I shall never forgive it," she said, "for what it
has done to me and mine."</p>

<p>"But you are here, and you have brought your
boy; that's a thing to be thankful for, Nancy."</p>

<p>They were silent in the face of overwhelming
memories. The only sound in the shadowy hall was
the ticking of the old clock&mdash;the old clock which
had tick-tocked in all the years of loneliness with no
one to listen.</p>

<p>Richard greeted him with heartiness. "This looks
pretty good to me, Cousin David."</p>

<p>"It's God's country, Richard. Brin hates it. He
loves his club and the city streets. But for me there's
nothing worth while but this sweep of the hills and
the river between."</p>

<p>He uncovered his basket. "Tom put up some
things for you. I've engaged Milly, a mulatto girl,
but she can't get here until to-morrow. She is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>[<a href="./images/44.png">44</a>]</span>
about the best there is left. Most of them go to
town. She'll probably seem pretty crude after New
York servants, Nancy."</p>

<p>"I don't care." Nancy almost sang the words.
"I don't care what I have to put up with, Cousin
David. I shall sleep to-night under my own roof
with nothing between me and the stars. And there
won't be anybody overhead or underneath, and there
won't be a pianola to the right of me, and a phonograph
to the left, and there won't be the rumble of
the subway or the crash of the elevated, and in the
morning I shall open my eyes and see the sun rise
over the river, and I shall look out upon the world
that I love and have loved all of these years&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And now she was crying, and Richard had her in
his arms. Over her head he looked at the older
man. "I didn't dream that she felt like this."</p>

<p>"I knew&mdash;as soon as I saw her. You must never
take her back, Richard."</p>

<p>"Of course not," hotly.</p>

<p>Yet with the perverseness of youth he was aware,
as he said it, of a sudden sense of revolt against the
prospect of a future spent in this quiet place. Flashing
came a vision of the city he had left, of crowded
hospitals, of big men consulting with big men, of old
men imparting their secrets of healing to the young;
of limousines speeding luxuriously on errands of
mercy; of patients pouring out their wealth to the
men who had made them well.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>[<a href="./images/45.png">45</a>]</span>
All this he had given up because his mother had
asked it. She had spoken of the place which his
grandfather had filled, of the dignity of a country
practice, of the opportunities for research and for
experiment. At close range, the big town set between
its rivers and the sea had seemed noisy and
vulgar. Its people had seemed mad in their race for
money. Its medical men had seemed to lack the
fineness and finish which come to those who move
and meditate in quiet places.</p>

<p>But seen from afar as he saw it now, it seemed a
wonder city, its tall buildings outlined like gigantic
castles against the sky. It seemed filled to the brim
with vivid life. It seemed, indeed, to call him back!</p>

<p>While David and Nancy talked he went out, and,
from the top of the snowy steps, surveyed his
domain. Back and back in the wide stretch of
country which faced him, beyond the valleys, on the
other side of the hills, were people who would some
day listen for the step of young Richard as those
who had gone before had listened for the step of his
grandfather. He saw himself going forth on stormy
nights to fight pain and pestilence; to minister to
little children, to patient mothers; to men beaten
down by an enemy before whom their strength was
as wax. They would wait for him, anxious for his
verdict, yet fearing it, welcoming him as a saviour,
who would stand with flaming sword between disease
and the Dark Angel.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>[<a href="./images/46.png">46</a>]</span>
The schoolhouse was on the other side of the road.
It was built of brick like the house. Richard's grandfather
had paid for the brick. He had believed in
public schools and had made this one possible.
Children came to it from all the countryside. There
were other schools in the sleepy town. This was
the Crossroads school, as Richard Tyson had been
the Crossroads doctor. He had given himself to a
rural community&mdash;his journeys had been long and
his life hard, but he had loved the labor.</p>

<p>The bell rang for the noon recess. The children
appeared presently, trudging homeward through
the snow to their midday dinners. Then Anne Warfield
came out. She wore a heavy brown coat and
soft brown hat. In her hand was a small earthen
dish. She strewed seeds for the birds, and they flew
down in front of her&mdash;juncoes and sparrows, a tufted
titmouse, a cardinal blood-red against the whiteness.
She was like a bird herself in all her brown.</p>

<p>When the dish was empty, she turned it upside
down, and spread her hands to show that there was
nothing more. On the Saturday night when she
had waited on the table, Richard had noticed the
loveliness of her hands. They were small and white,
and without rings. Yet in spite of their smallness
and whiteness, he knew that they were useful hands,
for she had served well at Bower's. And now he
knew that they were kindly hands, for she had fed
the birds who had come begging to her door.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>[<a href="./images/47.png">47</a>]</span>
Peggy joined her, and the two came out the gate
together. Anne looking across saw Richard. She
hesitated, then crossed the road.</p>

<p>He at once went to meet her. She flushed a little
as she spoke to him. "Peggy and I want to ask a
favor. We've always had our little Twelfth Night
play in the Crossroads stable. And we had planned
for it this year&mdash;you see, we didn't know that you
were coming."</p>

<p>"And we were afraid that you wouldn't want us,"
Peggy told him.</p>

<p>"Were you really afraid?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't. But Miss Anne was."</p>

<p>"I told the children that they mustn't be disappointed
if we were not able to do this year as we had
done before. I felt that with people in the house, it
might not be pleasant for them to have us coming in
such a crowd."</p>

<p>"It will be pleasant, and mother will be much interested.
I wish you'd come up and tell us about it."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Peggy and I have just
time to get back to Bower's for our dinner."</p>

<p>"Aren't the roads bad?"</p>

<p>"Not when the snow is hard."</p>

<p>Peggy went reluctantly. "I think he is perfectly
lovely," she said, at a safe distance. "Don't you?"</p>

<p>Anne's reply was guarded. "He is very kind. I
am glad that he doesn't mind about the Twelfth
Night play, Peggy."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>[<a href="./images/48.png">48</a>]</span>
Richard spoke to David of Anne as the two men, a
few minutes later, climbed the hill toward David's
house.</p>

<p>"She seems unusual."</p>

<p>"She is the best teacher we have ever had, but
she ought not to be at Bower's. She isn't their
kind."</p>

<p>David's little house, set on top of a hill, was small
and shabby without, but within it was as compact as
a ship's cabin. David's old servant, Tom, kept it
immaculate, and there were books everywhere, old
portraits, precious bits of mahogany.</p>

<p>From the window beside the fireplace there was
a view of the river. It was a blue river to-day,
sparkling in the sunshine. David, standing beside
Richard, spoke of it.</p>

<p>"It isn't always blue, but it is always beautiful.
Even when the snow flies as it did yesterday."</p>

<p>"And are you content with this, Cousin David?"</p>

<p>The answer was evasive. "I have my little law
practice, and my books. And is any one ever content,
Richard?"</p>

<p>Going down the hill, Richard pondered. Was
Eve right after all? Did a man who turned his face
away from the rush of cities really lack red blood?</p>

<p>Stopping at the schoolhouse, he found teacher
and scholars still gone. But the door was unlocked
and he went in. The low-ceiled room was charming,
and the good taste of the teacher was evident in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>[<a href="./images/49.png">49</a>]</span>
its decorations. There were branches of pine and
cedar on the walls, a picture of Washington at one
end with a flag draped over it, a pot of primroses in
the south window.</p>

<p>There were several books on Anne's desk. Somewhat
curiously he examined the titles. A shabby
Browning, a modern poet or two, Chesterton, a
volume of Pepys, the pile topped by a small black
Bible. Moved by a sudden impulse, he opened the
Bible. The leaves fell back at a marked passage:</p>

<p>"<i>Let not your heart be troubled.</i>"</p>

<p>He shut the book sharply. It was as if he had
peered into the girl's soul. The red was in his
cheeks as he turned away.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>That night Nancy Brooks went with Richard to
his room. On the threshold she stopped.</p>

<p>"I have given this room to you," she said,
"because it was mine when I was a girl, and all my
dreams have been shut in&mdash;waiting for you."</p>

<p>"Mother," he caught her hands in his, "you
mustn't dream too much for me."</p>

<p>"Let me dream to-night;" she was looking up at
him with her shining eyes; "to-morrow I shall be
just a commonplace mother of a commonplace son;
but to-night I am queen, and you are the crown
prince on the eve of coronation. Oh, Hickory
Dickory, I am such a happy mother."</p>

<p>Hickory Dickory! It was her child-name for him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>[<a href="./images/50.png">50</a>]</span>
She had not often used it of late. He felt that she
would not often use it again. He was much moved
by her dedication of him to his new life. He held
her close. His doubts fled. He thought no more
of Eve and of her flaming arguments. Somewhere
out in the snow her rose lay frozen and faded where
he had dropped it.</p>

<p>And when he slept and dreamed it was of a little
brown bird which sang in the snow, and the song
that it sang seemed to leap from the pages of a Book,
"<i>Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be
afraid.</i>"</p>

<h3><i>In Which Three Kings Come to Crossroads.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Anne's</span> budget of news to her Great-uncle Rod
swelled to unusual proportions in the week following
the opening of Crossroads. She had so much
to say to him, and there was no one else to whom
she could speak with such freedom and frankness.</p>

<p class="right"><i>By the Round Stove.</i>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear:</span></p>

<p>I am sending this as an antidote for my doleful
Sunday screed. Now that the Lovely Ladies are
gone, I am myself again!</p>

<p>I know that you are saying, "You should never
have been anything but yourself." That's all very
well for you who know Me-Myself, but these people
know only the Outside-Person part of me, and the
Outside-Person part is stiff and old-fashioned, and
self-conscious. You see it has been so many months
since I have hobnobbed with Lilies-of-the-Field and
with Solomons-in-all-their-Glory. And even when I
did hobnob with them it was for such a little time,
and it ended so heart-breakingly. But I am not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>[<a href="./images/52.png">52</a>]</span>
going to talk of that, or I shall weep and wail again,
and that wouldn't be fair to you.</p>

<p>The last Old Gentleman left yesterday in the wake
of the Lovely Ladies. Did I tell you that Brinsley
Tyson is a cousin of Mrs. Brooks? His twin
brother, David, lives up the road. Brinsley is the
city mouse and David is the country one. They are
as different as you can possibly imagine. Brinsley
is fat and round and red, and David is thin and tall
and pale. Yet there is the "twin look" in their
faces. The high noses and square chins. Neither
of them wears a beard. None of the Old Gentlemen
does. Why is it? Is hoary-headed age a thing of
the dark and distant past? Are you the only one
left whose silver banner blows in the breeze? Are
the grandfathers all trying to look like boys to
match the grandmothers who try to look like girls?</p>

<p>Mrs. Brooks won't be that kind of grandmother.
She is gentle and serene, and the years will touch
her softly. I shall like her if she will let me. But
perhaps little school-teachers won't come within her
line of vision. You see I learned my lesson in those
short months when I peeped into Paradise.</p>

<p>I wonder how it would seem to be a Lily-of-the-Field.
I've never been one, have I? Even when I
was a little girl I used to stand on a chair to wipe
the dishes while you washed them. I felt very important
to be helping mother, and you would talk
about the dignity of labor&mdash;<i>you darling</i>, with the hot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>[<a href="./images/53.png">53</a>]</span>
water wrinkling and reddening your lovely long
fingers, which were made to paint masterpieces.</p>

<p>I am trying to pass on to my school children what
you have given to me, and oh, Uncle Rod, when I
speak to them I seem to be looking with you, straight
through the kitchen window, at the sunset. We
never knew that the kitchen sink was there, did we?
We saw only the sunsets. And now because you
are a darling dear, and because you are always seeing
sunsets, I am sending you a verse or two which
I have copied from a book which Geoffrey Fox left
last night at my door.</p>

<p class="right"><i>In the Schoolroom.</i>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</p>

<p>I told you that Geoffrey Fox left a book for me to
read. I told you that he wore eye-glasses on a black
ribbon, that he is writing a novel, and that I don't
like him. Well, he went into Baltimore this morning
to get his belongings, and when he comes back
he will stay until his book is finished. It will be interesting
to be under the same roof with a story. All
the shadows and corners will seem full of it. The
house will speak to him, and the people in it, though
none of the rest of us will hear the voices, and the
wind will speak and the leaping flames in the fireplace,
and the sun and the moon&mdash;and when the
snow comes it will whisper secrets in his ear and
presently it will be snowing all through the pages.</p>

<p>It snowed this morning, and from my desk I can
see young Dr. Brooks shoveling a path from his
front porch. He and his mother came to Crossroads
yesterday, and they have been very busy getting
settled. They have a colored maid, Milly, but no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>[<a href="./images/55.png">55</a>]</span>
man, and young Richard does all of the outside
work. I think I shall like him. Don't you remember
how as a little girl I always adored the
Lion-hearted king? I always think of him when I
see Dr. Brooks. He isn't handsome, but he is broad-shouldered
and big and blond. I haven't had but
one chance to speak to him since he and his mother
left Bower's. Perhaps I shan't have many chances
to speak to him. But a cat may look at a king!</p>

<p>I am all alone in the schoolroom. The children
went an hour ago. Eric and Beulah are to call for
me on their way home from town. They took
Peggy with them. Did I tell you that Eric is falling
in love with Beulah? I am not sure whether it
is the best thing for him, but I am sure it is for her.
She is very happy, and blushes when he looks at her.
He is finer than she, and bigger, mentally and spiritually.
He is crude, but he will grow as so many
American men do grow&mdash;and there are dreams in
his clear blue eyes. And, after all, it is the dreams
that count&mdash;as Salomon discovered.</p>

<p>Yet it may be that Eric will bring Beulah up to
his level. She is an honest little thing and good and
loving. Her life is narrow, and she thinks narrow
thoughts. But he is wise and kind, and already I
can see that she is trying to keep step with him&mdash;which
is as it should be.</p>

<p>I like to think that father and mother kept step
through all the years. She was his equal, his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>[<a href="./images/56.png">56</a>]</span>comrade;
she marched by his side with her head up
fitting her two short steps to his long stride.</p>

<p>King Richard has just waved to me. I stood up
to see the sunset&mdash;a band of gold with black above,
and he waved, and started to run across the road.
Then somebody called him from the house. Perhaps
it was the telephone and his first patient. If
I am ever ill, I should like to have a Lion-hearted
Doctor&mdash;wouldn't you?</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p class="right"><i>At the Sign of the Lantern.</i>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</p>

<p>I am with Diogenes in the stable, with the lantern
making deep shadows, and the loft steps for a desk.
Eric and Beulah came for me before I had asked a
question&mdash;an important question&mdash;so I am finishing
my letter here, while Eric puts Daisy in her stall,
and then he will post it for me.</p>

<p>Diogenes has had his corn, and is as happy as
Brinsley Tyson after a good dinner. Oh, such eating
and drinking! How these old men love it!
And you with your bread and milk and your book
propped up against the lamp, or your handful of
raisins and your book under a tree!</p>

<p>But I must scribble fast and ask my question. It
isn't easy to ask. So I'll put it in sections:</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Do you</span>
<span class="i8">ever</span>
<span class="i12">see</span>
<span class="i16">Jimmie&mdash;Ford?</span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>[<a href="./images/57.png">57</a>]</span></p>

<p>That is the first time that I have written his name
since I came here. I had made up my mind that I
wouldn't write it. But somehow the rose-colored
atmosphere of the other night, and these men of his
kind have brought it back&mdash;all those whirling weeks
when you warned me and I wouldn't listen. Uncle
Rod, if a woman hadn't an ounce of pride she might
meet such things. If I had not had a grandmother
as good as Jimmie's and better&mdash;I might have felt
less&mdash;stricken. Geoffrey Fox spoke to me on Saturday
in a way which&mdash;hurt. Perhaps I am too sensitive&mdash;but
I haven't quite learned to&mdash;hold up my
head.</p>

<p>You mustn't think that I am unhappy. Indeed, I
am not, except that I cannot be with you. But it is
good to know that you are comfortable, and that
Cousin Margaret is making it seem like home.
Some day we are to have a home, you and I, when
our ship comes in "with the sunset packed in the
hold." But now it is well that I have work to do.
I know that this is my opportunity, and that I must
make the most of it. There's that proverb of yours,
"The Lord sends us quail, but he doesn't send them
roasted." I have written it out, and have tucked it
into my mirror frame. I shall have to roast my own
quail. I only hope that I may prove a competent
cook!</p>

<p>Eric is here, and I must say "Good-bye." Diogenes
sends love, and a little feather that dropped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>[<a href="./images/58.png">58</a>]</span>
from his wing. Some day he will send a big one
for you to make a pen and write letters to me. I
love your letters, and I love you. And oh, you know
that you have all the heart's best of your own</p>

<p class="right"><i>The Morning After the Magi Came.</i>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</p>

<p>I am up early to tell you about it. But I must go
back a little because I have had so much else to talk
about that I haven't spoken of the Twelfth Night
play.</p>

<p>It seems that years ago, when old Dr. Brooks
first built the schoolhouse, the children used his
stable on Twelfth Night for a spectacle representing
the coming of the Wise Men.</p>

<p>Mr. David had told me of it, and I had planned to
revive the old custom this year, and had rehearsed
the children. I thought when I heard that the house
was to be occupied that I might have to give it
up. But Peggy and I plucked up our courage and
asked King Richard, and he graciously gave permission.</p>

<p>It was a heavenly night. Snow on the ground
and all the stars out. The children met in the
schoolhouse and we started in a procession. They
all wore simple little costumes, just some bit of
bright color draped to give them a quaint picturesqueness.
One of the boys led a cow, and there
was an old ewe. Then riding on a donkey, bor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>[<a href="./images/59.png">59</a>]</span>rowed
by Mr. David, came the oldest Mary in our
school. I chose her because I wanted her to understand
the sacred significance of her name, and our
only little Joseph walked by her side. The children
followed and their parents, with the wise men quite
in the rear, so that they might enter after the
others.</p>

<p>When we reached the stable, I grouped Joseph
and Mary in one of the old mangers, where the Babe
lay, and he was a dear, real, baby brother of Mary.
I hid a light behind the straw, so that the place was
illumined. And then my little wise men came in;
and the children, who with their parents were seated
on the hay back in the shadows, sang, "We Three
Kings" and other carols. The gifts which the Magi
brought were the children's own pennies which they
are giving to the other little children across the sea
who are fatherless because of the war.</p>

<p>It was quite wonderful to hear their sweet little
voices, and to see their rapt faces and to know that,
however sordid their lives might be, here was
Dream, founded on the Greatest Truth, which would
lift them above the sordidness.</p>

<p>Dr. Brooks and his mother and Mr. David were
not far from me, and Dr. Brooks leaned over and
asked if he might speak to the children. I said I
should be glad, so he stood up and told them in
such simple, fine fashion that he wanted to be to
them all that his grandfather had been to their par<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>[<a href="./images/60.png">60</a>]</span>ents
and grandparents. He wanted them to feel
that his life and service belonged to them. He
wanted them to know how pleased he was with the
Twelfth Night spectacle, and that he wanted it to
become an annual custom.</p>

<p>Then in his mother's name, he asked them to
come up to the house&mdash;all of them&mdash;and we were
shown into the Garden Room which opens out upon
what was once a terraced garden, and there was a
great cake with candles, and sandwiches, and
coffee for the grown-ups and hot chocolate for the
kiddies.</p>

<p>Wasn't that dear? I had little Fran&ccedil;ois thank
them, and he did it so well. Why is it that these
small foreigners lack the self-consciousness of our
own boys and girls? He had been one of the wise
men in the spectacle, and he still wore his white
beard and turban and his long blue and red robes.
Yet he wasn't in the least fussed; he simply made a
bow, said what he had to say, made another bow,
with never a blush or a quaver or giggle. His
mother was there, and she was so happy&mdash;she is a
widow, and sews in the neighborhood, plain sewing,
and they are very poor.</p>

<p>I rode home with the Bowers, and as we drove
along, I heard the children singing. I am sure they
will never forget the night under the winter stars,
nor the scene in the stable with the cow and the
little donkey and the old ewe, and the Light that il<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>[<a href="./images/61.png">61</a>]</span>lumined
the manger. I want them always to remember,
Uncle Rod, and I want to remember. It
is only when I forget that I lose faith and hope.</p>
<p class="right">Blessed dear, good-night.&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Your Anne.</span>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</p>

<hr class="full" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>[<a href="./images/62.png">62</a>]</span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3><i>In Which Peggy Takes the Center of the Stage.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> bell on the schoolhouse had a challenging
note. It seemed to call to the distant hills,
and the echo came back in answer. It was the voice
of civilization. "I am here that you may learn of
other hills and of other valleys, of men who have
dreamed and of men who have discovered, of nations
which have conquered and of nations which
have fallen into decay. I am here that you may
learn&mdash;<i>ding dong</i>&mdash;that you may learn, <i>ding ding</i>&mdash;that
you may learn&mdash;<i>ding dong ding</i>&mdash;of Life."</p>

<p>As she rang the bell, Anne had always a feeling of
exhilaration. Its message was clear to her. She
hoped it would be clear to others. She tried at least
to make it clear to her children.</p>

<p>And now they came streaming over the countryside,
big boys with their little sisters beside them,
big girls with their little brothers. Some on sleds
and some sliding. All rosy-cheeked with the coldness
of the morning.</p>

<p>As they filed in, Anne stood behind her desk.
They had opening exercises, and then the work of
the day began.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>[<a href="./images/63.png">63</a>]</span>
It began scrappily. Nobody had his mind upon
it. The children were much excited over the events
of the preceding night&mdash;over the play and the feast
which had followed.</p>

<p>Anne, too, was excited. On the way to school she
had met Richard, and he had joined her and had
told her of his first patient.</p>

<p>"I had to walk at one o'clock in the morning. I
must get a horse or a car. I am not quite sure that
I ought to afford a car. And I like the idea of a
horse. My grandfather rode a horse."</p>

<p>"Are you going to do all the things that your
grandfather did?"</p>

<p>He was aware of her quick smile. He smiled
back.</p>

<p>"Perhaps. I might do worse. He made great
cures with his calomel and his catnip tea."</p>

<p>"Did you cure your patient with catnip tea?"</p>

<p>"Last night? No. It was a child. Measles. I
told the rest of the family to stay away from school."</p>

<p>"It is probably too late. They will all have it."</p>

<p>"Have you?"</p>

<p>"No. I am never sick."</p>

<p>Her good health seemed to him another goddess
attribute. Goddesses were never ill. They lived
eternally with lovely smiles.</p>

<p>He felt this morning that the world was his. He
had been called up the night before by a man in
whose household there had been a tradition of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>[<a href="./images/64.png">64</a>]</span>
skill of Richard's grandfather. There had been the
memory, too, in the minds of the older ones of the
days when that other doctor had thundered up the
road to succor and to save. It was a proud moment
in their lives when they gave to Richard Tyson's
grandson his first patient. They felt that Providence
in sending sickness upon them had imposed not a
penance but a privilege.</p>

<p>Richard had known of their pride and had been
touched by it, and with the glow of their gratitude
still upon him, he had trudged down the snowy road
and had met Anne Warfield!</p>

<p>"You'd better let me come and look over your
pupils," he had said to her as they parted; "we
don't want an epidemic!"</p>

<p>He was to come at the noon recess. Anne, anticipating
his visit, was quite thrillingly emphatic in her
history lesson. Not that history had anything to do
with measles, but she felt fired by his example to do
her best.</p>

<p>She loved to teach history, and she had a lesson
not only for her children, but for herself. She was
much ashamed of her mood of Sunday. It had been
easy enough this morning to talk to Richard; and
with Evelyn away, clothes had seemed to sink to their
proper significance. And if she had waited on the
table she had at least done it well.</p>

<p>Her exposition gained emphasis, therefore, from
her state of mind.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>[<a href="./images/65.png">65</a>]</span>
"In this beautiful land of ours," she said, "all
men are free&mdash;and equal. You mustn't think this
means that all of you will have the same amount of
money or the same kind of clothes, or the same
things to eat, or even the same kind of minds. But
I think it means that you ought all to have the same
kind of consciences. You ought to be equal in right
doing. And in love of country. You ought to know
when war is righteous, and when peace is righteous.
And you can all be equal in this, that no man can
make you lie or steal or be a coward."</p>

<p>Thus she inspired them. Thus she saw them
thrill as she had herself been thrilled. And that was
her reward. For in her school were not only the
little Johns and the little Thomases and the little
Richards&mdash;she found herself quite suddenly understanding
why there were so many Richards&mdash;there
were also the little Ottos and the little Ulrics and the
little Wilhelms, and there was Fran&ccedil;ois, whose mother
went out to sew by the day, and there were Raphael
and Alessandro and Simon. Out from the big cities
had come the parents of these children, seeking the
land, usurping the places of the old American stock,
doing what had been left undone in the way of sowing
and planting and reaping, making the little
gardens yield as they had never yielded, even in
those wonder days before the war.</p>

<p>It was Anne Warfield's task to train the children
of the newcomers to the American ideal. With the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>[<a href="./images/66.png">66</a>]</span>
blood in her of statesmen and of soldiers it was
given to her to pass on the tradition of good citizenship.
She was, indeed, a torch-bearer, lighting the
way to love of country. Yet for a little while she
had forgotten it.</p>

<p>She had cried because she could not wear rose-color!</p>

<p>But now her head was high again, and when
Richard came she showed him her school, and he
shook hands first with the little girls and then with
the little boys, and he looked down their throats, and
asked them questions, and joked and prodded and
took their temperature, and he did it all in such happy
fashion that not even the littlest one was afraid.</p>

<p>And when Richard was ready to go, he said to
her, "I'll look after their bodies if you'll look after
their minds," and as she watched him walk away,
she had a tingling sense that they had formed a compact
which had to do with things above and beyond
the commonplace.</p>

<p>It began to snow in the afternoon, and it was
snowing hard when the school day ended. Eric
Brand came for Anne and Peggy in the funny little
station carriage which was kept at Bower's. Eric
and Anne sat on the front seat with Peggy between
them. The fat mare, Daisy, jogged placidly along
the still white road. There was a top to the carriage,
but the snow sifted in, so Anne wrapped Peggy in
an old shawl.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>[<a href="./images/67.png">67</a>]</span>
"I don't need anything," she said, when Eric
offered her a heavier covering. "I love it&mdash;like
this&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Eric Brand was big and blond and somewhat
slow in his movements. But he had brains and held
the position of telegraph operator at Bower's Station.
He had, too, a heart of romance. The day before
he had seen Evelyn toss the rose to Richard, and he
had found it later where Richard had dropped it.
He had picked it up, and had put it in water. It
had seemed to him that the flower must feel the
slight which had been put upon it.</p>

<p>He spoke now to Anne of Richard. "They say
he is a good doctor."</p>

<p>"I can't see why he came here."</p>

<p>"His mother wanted him to come. She hates the
city. She went there as a bride. Her husband was
rich, but he was always speculating. Sometimes
they were so poor that she had to do her own work,
and sometimes they had a half dozen servants. But
they never had a home. And then all at once he
lost other people's money as well as his own&mdash;and
he killed himself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She turned on him her startled eyes. "Richard's
father?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And after that young Brooks decided that
as soon as he finished his medical course he would
come here. He thinks that he came because he
wanted to come. But he won't stay."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>[<a href="./images/68.png">68</a>]</span>
"Why not?"</p>

<p>"You saw his friends. And the women. Some
day he'll go back and marry that girl&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Evelyn Chesley?"</p>

<p>"Is that her name? She threw him a rose;" he
forgot to tell her that he had seen it fade.</p>

<p>They had reached the stable garage. Diogenes
welcomed them from his warm corner. The old dog
Mamie who had followed the carriage shook the
snow from her coat and flopped down on the floor
to rest. The little horse Daisy steamed and whinnied.
It was a homely scene of sheltered creatures
in comfortable quarters. Anne knelt down by the
old drake, and he bent his head under her caressing
hand. Her face was grave. Eric, watching her,
asked; "Has it been a hard day?"</p>

<p>"No;" but she found herself suddenly tired.</p>

<p>She went in with Eric presently. They had a
good hot supper, and Anne was hungry. Gathered
around the table were Peter and his wife, Beulah
and Eric, with Peggy rounding out the half dozen.
Geoffrey Fox had gone to town to get his belongings.</p>

<p>Anne had a vision of Richard and his mother in the
big house. At their table would be lovely linen and
shining silver, and some little formality of service.
She felt that she belonged to people like that. She
had nothing in common with Peter and his wife and
with Eric Brand. Nor with Beulah.</p>

<p>Beulah was planning a little party for the evening.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>[<a href="./images/69.png">69</a>]</span>
There was to have been skating, but the warmer
weather and the snow had made that impossible.</p>

<p>"I don't know just what I'll do with them," she
said; "we might have games."</p>

<p>"Anne knows a lot of things." This from Peggy,
who was busy with her bread and milk.</p>

<p>"What things?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dancing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Anne flushed. "Peggy!"</p>

<p>"But we do. We make bows like this&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Peggy slid out of her chair and bobbed for them&mdash;a
most entrancing little curtsey, with all her curls
flying.</p>

<p>"And the boys do this." She was quite stiff as she
showed them how the little boys bowed.</p>

<p>Anne seemed to feel some need of defense.
"Well, they must learn manners."</p>

<p>Peggy, wound up, would not be interrupted. "We
dance like this," and away she went in a mad gallop.</p>

<p>Anne laughed. "It warms their blood when the
fire won't burn. Peggy, it isn't quite as bad as that.
Show them nicely."</p>

<p>So Peggy showed them some pretty steps, and
then came back to her bread and milk.</p>

<p>"We might dance." Beulah's mind was on her
party. "But some of them don't know how."</p>

<p>Anne offered no suggestions. She really might
have helped if she had cared to do it. But she did
not care.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>[<a href="./images/70.png">70</a>]</span>
When she had finished supper, Eric followed her
into the hall. "You'll come down, won't you?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure."</p>

<p>"Beulah would like it if you would."</p>

<p>"I have a lot of things to do."</p>

<p>"Let them go. You can always work. When
you hear the fire roaring up the chimney, you will
know that it is calling to you, 'Come down, come
down!'"</p>

<p>He stood and watched her as she climbed the stairs.
Then he went back and helped Beulah.</p>

<p>Beulah was really very pretty, and to-night her
cheeks were pink as she made her little plans with
him.</p>

<p>He gave himself pleasantly to her guidance. He
moved the furniture for her into the big front room,
so that there would be a space for dancing. And
presently it became not a sanctum for staid Old
Gentlemen, but a gathering place for youth and joy.</p>

<p>Eric made his rounds before the company came.
He looked after the dogs in the kennels and at
Daisy in her stall. He flashed his lantern into Diogenes'
dark corner and saw the old drake at rest.</p>

<p>The snow was whirling in a blinding storm when
at last he staggered in with a great log for the fire,
and with a basket of cones to make the air sweet.
And it was as he knelt to put the cones on the fire
that Anne came in and stood beside him.</p>

<p>She had swept up her hair in the new way from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>[<a href="./images/71.png">71</a>]</span>
her forehead. She wore white silk stockings and
little flat-heeled black slippers, and a flounced white
frock. She was not in the least in fashion, but she
was quaintly childish and altogether lovely.</p>

<p>The big man looked up at her. "You look nice
in that dress."</p>

<p>She smiled down at him. "I'm glad you like it,
Eric."</p>

<p>When the young belles and beauties of the countryside
came in later, Anne found herself quite eclipsed
by their blooming charms. The young men, knowing
her as the school-teacher, were afraid of her
brains. They talked to her stiffly, and left her as
soon as possible for the easier society of girls of
their own kind. Peggy sat with Anne on the big
settle beside the fire. The child's hand was hot, and
she seemed sleepy.</p>

<p>"My eyes hurt," she said, crossly.</p>

<p>"You ought to be in bed, Peggy; shall I take you?"</p>

<p>"No. There's going to be an oyster stew.
Daddy said I might sit up."</p>

<p>Beulah in pink and very important came over to
them. "Could you show us some of the dances,
Anne?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Beulah, can't they play games?"</p>

<p>"I think you might help us." Beulah's tone was
slightly petulant.</p>

<p>Anne stood up. "There's a march I taught the
children. We could begin with that."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>[<a href="./images/72.png">72</a>]</span>
She led the march with Eric. Behind her was the
loud laughter of the brawny young men, the loud
laughter of the blooming young women. Their
merriment sounded a different note from that struck
by the genial Old Gentlemen or by the gay group of
young folk from New York. What was the difference?
Training? Birth?</p>

<p>Anne felt suddenly much alone. She had not belonged
to Evelyn Chesley's crowd, she did not belong
with Beulah's friends. She wondered if she
really belonged anywhere.</p>

<p>Yet as her mind went over and over these things,
her little slippered feet led the march. Eric was not
awkward, and he fell easily into the step.</p>

<p>"How nicely we do it together," he said, and
beamed down on her, and because her heart was
really a kind little heart and a womanly one, she
smiled up at him and tried to be as fine and friendly
as she would have wanted her children to be.</p>

<p>After the dance, the young folks played old-fashioned
games&mdash;"Going to Jerusalem" and "Post
Office." Anne fled to the settle when the last game
was announced. Peggy was moping among the
cushions.</p>

<p>"Let me take you up to bed, dearie."</p>

<p>"No, I won't. I want to stay here."</p>

<p>The fun was fast and furious. Anne had a little
shivery feeling as she watched the girls go out into
the hall and come back blushing. How could they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>[<a href="./images/73.png">73</a>]</span>
give so lightly what seemed to her so sacred? A
woman's lips were for her lover.</p>

<p>She sat very still among the cushions. The fire
roared up the chimney. Outside the wind blew;
far away in the distance a dog barked.</p>

<p>The barking dog was young Toby. At the
heels of his master he was headed straight for
the long low house and the grateful shelter of its
warmth.</p>

<p>Richard stood for a moment on the porch, looking
in through the lighted window. A romping game
was in full progress. This time it was "Drop the
Handkerchief" and a plump and pretty girl was
having a tussle with her captor. Everybody was
shouting, clapping. Everybody? On an old settle
by the fire sat a slim girl in a white gown. Peggy
lay in the curve of her arm, and she was looking
down at Peggy.</p>

<p>Richard laughed a big laugh. He could not have
told why he laughed, but he flung the door open,
and stood there radiant.</p>

<p>"May I come in?" he demanded of Beulah, "or
will I break up your party?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Dr. Brooks, as if you could. We are so
glad to have you."</p>

<p>"I had a sick call, and we are half frozen, Toby
and I, and we saw the lights&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Now the best place for a half-frozen man is by the
fire, and the best place for an anxious and shivering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>[<a href="./images/74.png">74</a>]</span>
dog is in a warm chimney corner, so in a moment
the young dog Toby was where he could thaw out
in a luxurious content, and Richard was on the settle
beside Anne, and was saying, "Isn't this great? Do
you think I ought to stay? I'm not really invited,
you know."</p>

<p>"There's never any formality. Everybody just
comes."</p>

<p>"I like your frock," he said suddenly. "You remind
me of a little porcelain figure I saw in a Fifth
Avenue window not long ago."</p>

<p>"Tell me about it," she said with eagerness.</p>

<p>"About what?"</p>

<p>"New York and the shops. Oh, I saw them once.
They were like&mdash;Heaven."</p>

<p>She laughed up at him as she said it, and he
laughed back.</p>

<p>"You'd get tired of them if you lived there."</p>

<p>"I should never get tired. And if I had money
I'd go on in and try on everything. I saw a picture
of a gown I'd like&mdash;all silver spangles with a pointed
train. Do you know I've never worn a train? I
should like one&mdash;and a big fan with feathers."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Trains wouldn't suit your
style. Nor big fans. You ought to have a little
fan&mdash;of sandalwood, with a purple and green tassel
and smelling sweet. Mother says that her mother
carried a fan like that at a White House ball."</p>

<p>"I've never been to a ball."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>[<a href="./images/75.png">75</a>]</span>
"Well, you needn't want to go. It's a cram and
a jam and everybody bored to death."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be bored. I should love it."</p>

<p>His eyes were on the fire. And presently he said,
"It seems queer to be away from it&mdash;New York.
There's something about it that gets into your blood.
You want it&mdash;as you do&mdash;drink."</p>

<p>"Then you'll be going back."</p>

<p>He jerked around to look at her. "No," sharply;
"what makes you say that?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;it&mdash;it doesn't seem possible that you
could be&mdash;buried&mdash;here."</p>

<p>"Do you feel buried?"</p>

<p>She nodded. "Oh, yes."</p>

<p>His face was grave. "And doesn't the school
work&mdash;help?"</p>

<p>She caught her breath. "That's the best part of
it. You see I love&mdash;the children."</p>

<p>He flashed a quick glance at her. "Then you're
lonely sometimes?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I fancy these people aren't exactly&mdash;your kind.
I wish you'd come and see my mother. She's awfully
worth while, you know. And she'd be so glad
to have you."</p>

<p>She found herself saying, "My grandmother was
Cynthia Warfield. She knew your grandfather. I
have some old letters. I think your mother might
like to see them."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>[<a href="./images/76.png">76</a>]</span>
"No wonder I've been puzzling over you! Cynthia
Warfield's portrait hangs in our library. And
you're like your grandmother. Only you're young
and&mdash;alive."</p>

<p>Again his ringing laugh and her own to meet it.
She felt so young and happy. So very, very young,
and so very, very happy!</p>

<p>Mrs. Bower, appearing importantly, announced
supper. Beyond the hall, through the open door of
the dining-room they could see the loaded table
with the tureens of steaming oysters at each end.</p>

<p>There was at once a rollicking stampede.</p>

<p>Anne leaned down to wake Peggy. The child
opened her heavy eyes, and murmured: "I want
a drink."</p>

<p>Richard glanced at her. "Hello, hello," he said,
quickly. "What's the matter, Pussy?"</p>

<p>"I'm not Pussy&mdash;I'm Peggy." The child was
ready for tears.</p>

<p>He picked her up in his arms and carried her to
the light. With careful finger he lifted the heavy
eyelids and touched the hot little cheeks. "How
long has she been this way?" he asked Anne.</p>

<p>"Just since supper. Is there anything the matter
with her? Is she really sick, Dr. Brooks?"</p>

<p>"Measles," he said succinctly. "You'd better get
her straight to bed."</p>

<h3><i>In Which a Gray Plush Pussy Cat Supplies a Theme.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Anne</span> at the top of the stairs talked to Geoffrey
Fox at the foot.</p>

<p>"But you really ought not to stay."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because if you haven't had the measles you
might get them, and, besides, poor Mrs. Bower is so
busy."</p>

<p>"Why not tell me the truth? You don't want
me to stay."</p>

<p>"What difference can it possibly make to me?"</p>

<p>"It may make a great difference," Geoffrey said,
quietly, "whether I go or stay, but we won't talk of
that. I am here. All my traps, bag and baggage,
typewriter and trunks&mdash;books and bathrobe&mdash;and
yet you want to send me away."</p>

<p>"I haven't anything to do with it. But the house
is closed to every one."</p>

<p>"And everything smells of antiseptics. I rather
like that. I spent six weeks in a hospital once. I
had a nervous breakdown, and the quiet was
heavenly, and all the nurses were angels."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>[<a href="./images/78.png">78</a>]</span>
She would not smile. "Of course if you will
stay," she said, "you must take things as they
come. Mrs. Bower will send your meals up to you.
She won't have time to set a company table."</p>

<p>"I'm not company; let me eat with the rest of
you."</p>

<p>She hesitated. "You wouldn't like it. I don't
like it. There's no service, you see&mdash;we all just
help ourselves."</p>

<p>"I can help myself."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "It will be easier for Mrs.
Bower to bring it up."</p>

<p>He climbed three steps and stopped. "Are you
going to do all the nursing?"</p>

<p>"I shall do some of it. Peggy is really ill. There
are complications. And Mrs. Bower and Beulah
have so much to do. We shall have to close the
school. Dr. Brooks wants to save as many as possible
from having it."</p>

<p>"So Brooks is handling Peggy's case."</p>

<p>"Of course. Peter Bower knew his grandfather."</p>

<p>"Well, it is something to have a grandfather.
And to follow in his footsteps."</p>

<p>But her mind was not on grandfathers. "Dr.
Brooks will be here in an hour and I must get
Peggy's room ready. And will you please look
after yourself for a little while? Eric will attend to
your trunks."</p>

<p>It took Geoffrey all the morning to settle. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>[<a href="./images/79.png">79</a>]</span>
heard Richard come and go. At noon Anne brought
up his tray.</p>

<p>Opening the door to her knock, he protested.
"You shouldn't have done it."</p>

<p>"Why not? It is all in the day's work. And I
am not going to be silly about it any more."</p>

<p>"You were never silly about it."</p>

<p>"Yes, I was. But I have worked it all out in my
mind. My bringing up the tray to you won't make
me any less than I am or any more. It is the way
we feel about ourselves that counts&mdash;not what other
people think of us."</p>

<p>"So you don't care what I think of you?"</p>

<p>"No, not if I am doing the things I think are
right."</p>

<p>"And you don't care what Richard Brooks
thinks?"</p>

<p>The color mounted. "No," steadily.</p>

<p>"Nor Miss Chesley?"</p>

<p>"Of course not."</p>

<p>"Not of course. You do care. You'd hate it if
you thought they'd criticize. And you'd cry after
you went to bed."</p>

<p>She felt that such clairvoyance was uncanny. "I
wouldn't cry."</p>

<p>"Well, you'd feel like it."</p>

<p>"Please don't talk about me in that way. It really
doesn't make any difference how I feel, does it?
And your lunch is getting cold."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>[<a href="./images/80.png">80</a>]</span>
"What made you bring it? Why didn't you let
Mrs. Bower or Beulah?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bower is lying down, and Beulah has been
ironing all the morning."</p>

<p>"The next time call me, and I'll wait upon myself."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shall." She surveyed his tray. "I've
forgotten the cream for your coffee."</p>

<p>"I don't take cream. Oh, please don't go. I
want you to see my books and my other belongings."</p>

<p>He had brought dozens of books, a few pictures,
a little gilded Chinese god, a bronze bust of
Napoleon.</p>

<p>"Everything has a reason for being dragged
around with me. That etching of Helleu's is like
my little sister, Mimi, who is at school in a convent,
and who constitutes my whole family. The gilded
Chinese god is a mascot&mdash;the Napoleon intrigues
the imagination."</p>

<p>"Do you think so much of Napoleon?" coldly.
"He was a little great man. I'd rather talk to my
children of George Washington."</p>

<p>"You women have a grudge against him because
of Josephine."</p>

<p>"Yes. He killed something in himself when he
put her from him. And the world knew it, and his
downfall began. He forgot that love is the greatest
thing in the world."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>[<a href="./images/81.png">81</a>]</span>
How lovely she was, all fire and feeling!</p>

<p>"Jove," he said, staring, "if you could write,
you'd make people sit up and listen. You've kept
your dreams. That's what the world wants&mdash;the
stuff that dreams are made of. And most of us
have lost ours by the time we know how to put
things on paper."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>For days the sound of Geoffrey's typewriter could
be heard in the hall. "Does it disturb Peggy?" he
asked Anne late one night as he met her on the stairs.</p>

<p>"No; her room is too far away. You were so
good to send her the lovely toys. She adores the
plush pussy cat."</p>

<p>"I like cats. They are coy&mdash;and caressing. Dogs
are too frankly adoring."</p>

<p>"The eternal masculine." She smiled at him.
"Is your work coming on?"</p>

<p>"I have a first chapter. May I read it to you?"</p>

<p>"Please&mdash;I should love it."</p>

<p>She was glad to sit quietly by the big fireplace.
With eyes half-closed, she listened to the opening
sentences. But as he proceeded, her listlessness
vanished. And when he laid down the manuscript
she was leaning forward, her slim hands clasped
tensely on her knees, her eyes wide with interest.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh," she told him, "how do you know it all&mdash;how
can you make them live and breathe&mdash;like
that?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>[<a href="./images/82.png">82</a>]</span>
For a moment he did not answer, then he said,
"I don't know how I do it. No artist knows how
he creates. It is like Life and Death&mdash;and other
miracles. If I could keep to this pace, I'd have a
masterpiece. But I shan't keep to it."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I never do."</p>

<p>"But this time&mdash;with such a beginning."</p>

<p>"Will you be my critic, Mistress Anne? Let me
read to you now and then&mdash;like this?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid I should spoil you with praise. It
all seems so&mdash;wonderful."</p>

<p>"You can't spoil me, and I like to be wonderful."</p>

<p>In spite of his egotism, she found herself modifying
her first unfavorable estimate of him. His quick
eager speech, his mobile mouth, his mop of dark
hair, his white restless hands, his long-lashed near-sighted
eyes, these contributed a personality which
had in it nothing commonplace or conventional.</p>

<p>For three nights he read to her. On the fourth he
had nothing to read. "It is the same old story," he
burst out passionately. "I see mountain peaks,
then, suddenly, darkness falls and my brain is
blank."</p>

<p>"Wait a little," she told him; "it will come back."</p>

<p>"But it never comes back. All of my good beginnings
flat out toward the end. And that's why I'm
pot-boiling, because," bitterly, "I am not big enough
for anything else."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>[<a href="./images/83.png">83</a>]</span>
"You mustn't say such things. We achieve only
as we believe in ourselves. Don't you know that?
If you believe that things are going to end badly,
they will end badly."</p>

<p>"Oh, wise little school-teacher, how do you
know?"</p>

<p>"It is what I teach my children. That they must
believe in themselves."</p>

<p>"What else do you teach them?"</p>

<p>"That they must believe in God and love their
country, and then nothing can happen to them that
they cannot bear. It is only when one loses faith
and hope that life doesn't seem worth while."</p>

<p>"And do you believe all that you teach?"</p>

<p>Silence. She was gazing into the fire thoughtfully.
"I believe it, but I don't always live up to it.
That's the hard part, acting up the things that we
believe. I tell my children that, and I tell them, too,
that they must always keep on trying."</p>

<p>She was delicious with her theories and her seriousness.
And she was charming in the crisp blue
gown that had been her uniform since the beginning
of Peggy's illness.</p>

<p>He laughed and leaned toward her. "Oh, Mistress
Anne, Mistress Anne, how much you have to learn."</p>

<p>She stood up. "Perhaps I know more than you
think."</p>

<p>"Are you angry because I said that? But I love
your arguments."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>[<a href="./images/84.png">84</a>]</span>
His frankness was irresistible; she could not take
offense so she sat down again.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she said, hesitating, "you might understand
better how I feel if I told you about my Great-uncle
Rodman Warfield. When he was very young
he went to Paris to study art, and he attracted much
attention. Then after a while he began to find the
people interested him more than pictures. You see
we come from old Maryland stock. My grandmother,
Cynthia Warfield, was one of the proudest
women in Carroll. But Uncle Rodman doesn't believe
in family pride, not the kind that sticks its nose
in the air; and so when he came back to America
he resolved to devote his talents to glorifying the
humble. He lived among the poor and he painted
pictures of them. And then one day there was an
accident. He saved a woman from drowning between
a ferry-boat and the slip, and he hurt his back.
There was a sort of paralysis that affected the nerves
of his hand&mdash;and he couldn't paint any more. He
came to us&mdash;when I was a little girl. My father was
dead, and mother had a small income. We couldn't
afford servants, so mother sewed and Uncle Rod and
I did the housework. And it was he who tried to
teach me that work is the one royal thing in our
lives."</p>

<p>"Where is he now?"</p>

<p>"When mother died our income was cut off, and&mdash;I
had to leave him. He could have a home with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>[<a href="./images/85.png">85</a>]</span>
a cousin of ours and teach her children. I might
have stayed with her, but there was nothing for me
to do. And we felt that it was best for me to&mdash;find
myself. So I came here. He writes to me&mdash;every
day&mdash;&mdash;" She drew a long breath. "I don't think
I could live without letters from my Uncle Rod."</p>

<p>"So you are really a princess in disguise, and
you would love to stick your nose in the air, but you
don't quite dare?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't love to do anything snobbish."</p>

<p>"There is no use in pretending that you are
humble when you are not. And your Great-uncle
Rodman is a dreamer. Life is what it is, not what
we want it to be."</p>

<p>"I like his dreams," she said, simply, "and I want
to be as good as he thinks I am."</p>

<p>"You don't have to be too good. You are too
pretty. Do you know that Cynthia Warfield's
granddaughter is a great beauty, Mistress Anne?"</p>

<p>"I know that I don't like to have you say such
things to me."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I am not sure that you mean them."</p>

<p>"But I do mean them," eagerly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," stiffly, "but we won't talk about it.
I must go up to Peggy."</p>

<p>Peter Bower was with Peggy. He was a round
and red-faced Peter with the kindest heart in the
world. And Peggy was the apple of his eye.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>[<a href="./images/86.png">86</a>]</span>
"Do you think she is better, Miss Anne?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do. And now you go and get some
sleep, Mr. Bower. I'll stay with her until four, and
then I'll wake Beulah."</p>

<p>He left her with the daily paper and a new
magazine, and with the light shaded, Anne sat down
to read. Peggy was sleeping soundly with both
arms around the plush pussy which Geoffrey had
given her. It was a most lifelike pussy, gray-striped
with green glass eyes and with a little red
mouth that opened and mewed when you pulled a
string. Hung by a ribbon around the pussy cat's
neck was a little brass bell. As the child stirred in
her sleep the little bell tinkled. There was no sound
except the sighing of the wind. All the house was
still.</p>

<p>The paper was full of news of the great war.
Anne read it carefully, and the articles on the same
subject in the magazine. She felt that she must
know as much as possible, so that she might speak
to her children intelligently of the great conflict. Of
Belgium and England, of France and Germany.
She must be fair, with all those clear eyes focussed
upon her. She must, indeed, attempt a sort of
neutrality. But how could she be neutral, with her
soul burning candles on the altar of the allies?</p>

<p>As she read on and on in the silence of the night,
there came to her the thought of the dead on the
field of battle. What of those shining souls? What<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>[<a href="./images/87.png">87</a>]</span>
happened after men went out into the Great Beyond?
Hun and Norman, Saxon and Slav, among
the shadows were they all at Peace?</p>

<p>Again the child stirred and the little bell tinkled.
It seemed to Anne that the bell and the staring eyes
were symbolic. The gay world played its foolish
music and looked with unseeing eyes upon murder
and madness. If little Peggy had lain there dead,
the little bell would still have tinkled, the wide green
eyes would still have stared.</p>

<p>But Peggy, thank God, was alive. Her face, like
old ivory against the whiteness of her pillow, showed
the ravages of illness, but the doctor had said she
was out of danger.</p>

<p>The child stirred and spoke. "Anne," she whispered,
"tell me about the bears."</p>

<p>Anne knelt beside the bed. "We must be very
quiet," she said. "I don't want to wake Beulah."</p>

<p>So very softly she told the story. Of the Daddy
Bear and the Mother Bear and the Baby Bear; of
the little House in the Woods; of Goldilocks, the
three bowls of soup, the three chairs, the three
beds&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>In the midst of it all Peggy sat up. "I want a
bowl of soup like the little bear."</p>

<p>"But, darling, you've had your lovely supper."</p>

<p>"I don't care." Peggy's lip quivered. "I'm just
starved, and I can't wait until I have my breakfast."</p>

<p>"Let me tell you the rest of the story."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>[<a href="./images/88.png">88</a>]</span>
"No. I don't want to hear it. I want a bowl of
soup like the little bear's."</p>

<p>"Maybe it wasn't nice soup, Peggy."</p>

<p>"But you <i>said</i> it was. You said that the Mother
Bear made it out of the corn from the farmer's field,
and the cock that the fox brought, and she seasoned
it with herbs that she found at the edge of the forest.
You said yourself it was <i>dee-licious</i> soup, Miss Anne."</p>

<p>She began to cry weakly.</p>

<p>"Dearie, don't. If I go down into the kitchen
and warm some broth will you keep very still?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Only I don't want just broth. I want
soup like the little bear had."</p>

<p>"Peggy, I am not a fairy godmother. I can't
wave my wand and get things in the middle of the
night."</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow, you can put it in a blue bowl, you
<i>said</i> the little bear had his in a blue bowl, and you
said he had ten crackers in it. I want ten crackers&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The kitchen was warm and shadowy, with the
light of a kerosene lamp above the cook-stove. Anne
flitted about noiselessly, finding a little saucepan,
finding a little blue bowl, breaking one cracker into
ten bits to satisfy the insistent Peggy, stirring the
bubbling broth with a spoon as she bent above it.</p>

<p>And as she stirred, she was thinking of Geoffrey
Fox, not as she had thought of Richard, with pulses
throbbing and heart fluttering, but calmly; of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>[<a href="./images/89.png">89</a>]</span>
book and of the little bust of Napoleon, and of the
things that she had been reading about the war.</p>

<p>She poured the soup out of the saucepan, and set
it steaming on a low tray. Then quietly she ascended
the stairs. Geoffrey's door was wide open
and his room was empty, but through the dimness
of the long hall she discerned his figure, outlined
against a wide window at the end. Back of him the
world under the light of the waning moon showed
black and white like a great wash drawing.</p>

<p>He turned as she came toward him. "I heard
you go down," he said. "I've been writing all
night&mdash;and I've written&mdash;perfect rot." His hands
went out in a despairing gesture.</p>

<p>Composed and quiet in her crisp linen, she looked
up at him. "Write about the war," she said; "take
three soldiers,&mdash;French, German and English. Make
their hearts hot with hatred, and then&mdash;let them lie
wounded together on the field of battle in the darkness
of the night&mdash;with death ahead&mdash;and let each
one tell his story&mdash;let them be drawn together by
the knowledge of a common lot&mdash;a common destiny&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What made you think of that?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Peggy's pussy cat." She told him of the staring
eyes and the tinkling bell. "But I mustn't stay.
Peggy is waiting for her soup."</p>

<p>He gazed at her with admiration. "How do you
do it?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>[<a href="./images/90.png">90</a>]</span>
"Do what?"</p>

<p>"Dictate a heaven-born plot to me in one breath,
and speak of Peggy's soup in the next. You are
like Werther's Charlotte."</p>

<p>"I am like myself. And we mustn't stay here
talking. It is time we were both in bed. I am going
to wake Beulah when I have fed Peggy."</p>

<p>He made a motion of salute. "The princess
serves," he said, laughing.</p>

<p>But as she passed on, calm and cool and collected,
carrying the tray before her like the famous Chocolate
lady on the backs of magazines, the laugh died
on his lips. She was not to be laughed at, this little
Anne Warfield, who held her head so high!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3><i>In Which Geoffrey Writes of Soldiers and Their
Souls.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Eve chesley</span> writing from New York was
still in a state of rebellion.</p>

<p>"And now they all have the <i>measles</i>. Richard, it
needed only your letter to let me know what you
have done to yourself. When I think of you, tearing
around the country on your old white horse,
with your ears tied up&mdash;I am sure you tie up your
ears&mdash;it is a perfect nightmare. Oh, Dicky Boy,
and you might be here specializing on appendicitis
or something equally reasonable and modern. I
feel as if the world were upside down. Do children
in New York ever have the measles? Somehow I
never hear of it. It seems to me almost archaic&mdash;like
mumps. Nobody in society ever has the
mumps, or if they do, they keep it a dead secret, like
a family skeleton, or a hard-working grandfather.</p>

<p>"Your letters are so short, and they don't tell me
what you do with your evenings. Don't you miss
us? Don't you miss me? And our good times?
And the golden lights of the city? Winifred Ames
wants you for a dinner dance on the twentieth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>[<a href="./images/92.png">92</a>]</span>
Can't you turn the measley kiddies over to some
one else and come? Say 'yes,' Dicky, dear. Oh,
you musn't be just a country doctor. You were
born for bigger things, and some day you will see
it and be sorry."</p>

<p>Richard's letter, dashed off between visits to the
"measley kiddies," was as follows:</p>

<p>"There aren't any bigger things, Eve, and I
shan't be sorry. I can't get away just now, and to
be frank, I don't want to. There is nothing dull
about measles. They have aspects of interest unknown
to a dinner dance. I am not saying that I
don't miss some of the things that I have left behind&mdash;my
good friends&mdash;you and Pip and the Dutton-Ames.
But there are compensations. And you
should see my horse. He's a heavy fellow like a
horse of Flanders; I call him Ben because he is big
and gentle. I don't tie up my ears, but I should if I
wanted to. And please don't think I am ungrateful
because I am not coming to the Dutton-Ames dance.
Why don't you and the rest drift down here for a
week-end? Next Friday, the Friday after? Let me
know. There's good skating now that the snows
have stopped."</p>

<p>He signed it and sealed it and on the way to see
little Peggy he dropped it into the box. Then he
entirely forgot it. It was a wonderful morning, with a
sky like sapphire above a white world, the dog Toby
racing ahead of him, and big gentle Ben at a trot.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>[<a href="./images/93.png">93</a>]</span>
At the innocent word "compensations" Evelyn
Chesley pricked up her ears. What compensations?
She got Philip Meade on the telephone.</p>

<p>"Richard has asked us for the week-end, Pip.
Could we go in your car?"</p>

<p>"Unless it snows again. But why seek such
solitudes, Eve?"</p>

<p>"I want to take Richard a fur cap. I am sure he
ties up his ears."</p>

<p>"Send it."</p>

<p>"In a cold-blooded parcel post package? I will
not. Pip, if you won't go, I'll kidnap Aunt Maude,
and carry her off by train."</p>

<p>"And leave me out? Not much. 'Whither thou
goest&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Even when I am on the trail of another man?
Pip, you are a dear idiot."</p>

<p>"The queen's fool."</p>

<p>So it was decided that on Friday, weather permitting,
they should go.</p>

<p>Aunt Maude, protesting, said, "It isn't proper,
Eve. Girls in my day didn't go running around
after men. They sat at home and waited."</p>

<p>"Why wait, dearest? When I see a good thing
I go for it."</p>

<p>"Eve&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"And anyhow I am not running after Dicky. I
am rescuing him."</p>

<p>"From what?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>[<a href="./images/94.png">94</a>]</span>
"From his mother, dearest, and his own dreams.
Their heads are in the clouds, and they don't
know it."</p>

<p>"I think myself that Nancy is making a mistake."</p>

<p>"More of a mistake than she understands." The
lightness left Eve's voice. She was silent as she ate
an orange and drank a cup of clear coffee. Eve's
fashionable and adorable thinness was the result
of abstinence and of exercise. Facing daily Aunt
Maude's plumpness, she had sacrificed ease and
appetite on the altar of grace and beauty.</p>

<p>Yet Aunt Maude's plumpness was not the plumpness
of inelegance. Nothing about Aunt Maude was
inelegant. She was of ancient Knickerbocker stock.
She had been petrified by years of social exclusiveness
into something less amiable than her curves
and dimples promised. Her hair was gray, and not
much of it was her own. Her curled bang and high
coronet braid were held flatly against her head by a
hair net. She wore always certain chains and bracelets
which proclaimed the family's past prosperity.
Her present prosperity was evidenced by the somewhat
severe richness of her attire. Her complexion
was delicately yellow and her wrinkles were deep.
Her eyes were light blue and coldly staring. In
manner she seemed to set herself against any world
but her own.</p>

<p>The money on which the two women lived was
Aunt Maude's. She expected to make Eve her heir.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>[<a href="./images/95.png">95</a>]</span>
In the meantime she gave her a generous allowance
and indulged most of her whims.</p>

<p>The latest whim was the new breakfast room in
which they now sat, with the winter sun streaming
through the small panes of a wide south window.</p>

<p>For sixty odd years Aunt Maude had eaten her
breakfast promptly at eight from a tray in her own
room. It had been a hearty breakfast of hot breads
and chops. At one she had lunched decently in
the long dim dining-room in a mid-Victorian atmosphere
of Moquet and marble mantels, carved walnut
and plush curtains.</p>

<p>And now back of this sacred dining-room Eve
had built out a structure of glass and of stone, looking
over a scrap of enclosed city garden, and furnished
in black and white, relieved by splashes of
brilliant color. Aunt Maude hated the green parrot
and the flame-colored fishes in the teakwood
aquarium. She thought that Eve looked like an
actress in the little jacket with the apple-green ribbons
which she wore when she came down at twelve.</p>

<p>"Aren't we ever going to eat any more luncheons?"
had been Aunt Maude's plaintive question
when she realized that she was in the midst of a
gastronomic revolution.</p>

<p>"Nobody does, dearest. If you are really up-to-date
you breakfast and dine&mdash;the other meals are
vague&mdash;illusory."</p>

<p>"People in my time&mdash;&mdash;" Aunt Maude had stated.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>[<a href="./images/96.png">96</a>]</span>
"People in your time," Evelyn had interrupted flippantly,
"were wise and good. Nobody wants to be
wise and good in these days. We want to be smart
and sophisticated. Your good old stuffy dining-rooms
were like your good old stuffy consciences.
Now my breakfast room is symbolic&mdash;the green and
white for the joy of living, and the black for my
sins."</p>

<p>She stood up on tiptoe to feed the parrot. "To-morrow,"
she announced, "I am to have a black
cat. I found one at the cat show&mdash;with green eyes.
And I am going to match his cushion to his eyes."</p>

<p>"I'd like a cat," Aunt Maude said, unexpectedly,
"but I can't say that I care for black ones. The
grays are the best mousers."</p>

<p>Eve looked at her reproachfully. "Do you think
that cats catch mice?" she demanded,&mdash;"up-to-date
cats? They sit on cushions and add emphasis to
the color scheme. Winifred Ames has a yellow one
to go with her primrose panels."</p>

<p>The telephone rang. A maid answered it. "It
is for you, Miss Evelyn."</p>

<p>"It is Pip," Eve said, as she turned from the telephone;
"he's coming up."</p>

<p>Aunt Maude surveyed her. "You're not going to
receive him as you are?"</p>

<p>"As I am? Why not?"</p>

<p>"Eve, go to your room and put something <i>on</i>,"
Aunt Maude agonized; "when I was a girl&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>[<a href="./images/97.png">97</a>]</span>
Evelyn dropped a kiss on her cheek. "When you
were a girl, Aunt Maude, you were very pretty, and
you wore very low necks and short sleeves on the
street, and short dresses&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Remembering the family album, Aunt Maude
stopped her hastily. "It doesn't make any difference
what I wore. You are not going to receive
any gentleman in that ridiculous jacket."</p>

<p>Eve surveyed herself in an oval mirror set above
a console-table. "I think I look rather nice. And
Pip would like me in anything. Aunt Maude, it's a
queer world for us women. The men that we want
don't want us, and the men that we don't want adore
us. The emancipation of women will come when
they can ask men to marry them."</p>

<p>She was ruffling the feathers on the green parrot's
head. He caught her finger carefully in his claw
and crooned.</p>

<p>Aunt Maude rose. "I had twenty proposals&mdash;your
uncle's was the twentieth. I loved him at first
sight, and I loved him until he left me."</p>

<p>"Uncle was a dear," Eve agreed, "but suppose
he hadn't asked you, Aunt Maude?"</p>

<p>"I should have remained single to the end of my
days."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you wouldn't, Aunt Maude. You would
have married the wrong man&mdash;that's the way it always
ends&mdash;if women didn't marry the wrong men
half the world would be old maids."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>[<a href="./images/98.png">98</a>]</span>
Philip Meade was much in love. He had money,
family, good looks and infinite patience. Some day
he meant to marry Eve. But he was aware that
she was not yet in love with him.</p>

<p>She came down gowned for the street. And thus
kept him waiting. "It was Aunt Maude's fault.
She made me dress. Pip, where shall we walk?"</p>

<p>He did not care. He cared only to be with her.
He told her so, and she smiled up at him wistfully.
"You're such a dear&mdash;I wish&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped.</p>

<p>"What do you wish?" he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"For the&mdash;sun. You are the moon. May I call
you my moon-man, Pip?"</p>

<p>He knew what she meant "Yes. But you
must remember that some day I shall not be content
to take second place&mdash;I shall fight for the head
of your line of lovers."</p>

<p>"Line of lovers&mdash;<i>Pip</i>. I don't like the sound
of it."</p>

<p>"Why not? It's true."</p>

<p>Again she was wistful. "I wonder how many of
them really&mdash;care? Pip, it is the one-proposal girl
who is lucky. She has no problems. She simply
takes the man she can get!"</p>

<p>They were swinging along Fifth Avenue. He
stopped at a flower shop and bought her a tight
little knot of yellow roses which matched her hair.
She was in brown velvet with brown boots and brown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>[<a href="./images/99.png">99</a>]</span>
furs. Her skin showed pink and white in the clear
cold. She and the big man by her side were a pair
good to look upon, and people turned to look.</p>

<p>Coming to a famous jewel shop she turned in. "I
am going to have all of Aunt Maude's opals set in
platinum to make a long chain. She gave them to
me; and there'll be diamonds at intervals. I want
to wear smoke-colored tulle at Winifred Ames' dinner
dance&mdash;and the opals will light it."</p>

<p>Philip Meade's mind was not poetic, yet as his
eyes followed Evelyn, he was aware that this was an
atmosphere which belonged to her. Her beauty was
opulent, needing richness to set it off, needing the
shine of jewels, the shimmer of silk&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>If he married her he could give her&mdash;a tiara of
diamonds&mdash;a necklace of pearls&mdash;a pendant&mdash;a ring.
His eyes swept the store adorning her.</p>

<p>When they came out he said, "I think I am
showing a greatness of mind which should win
your admiration."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"In taking you to Crossroads."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"You know why. Shall you write to Brooks that
we are coming?"</p>

<p>"No. I want it to be a surprise. That's half the
fun."</p>

<p>But there was nothing funny about it, as it
proved, for it was on that very Friday morning that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>[<a href="./images/100.png">100</a>]</span>
Richard had found Peggy much better, and Anne
very pale with circles under her eyes.</p>

<p>He went away, and later his mother called Anne
up. She asked her to spend the day at Crossroads.
Richard would come for her and would bring her
home after dinner.</p>

<p>Anne, with a fluttering sense of excitement, packed
her ruffled white frock in a little bag, and was ready
when Richard arrived.</p>

<p>At the gate they met Geoffrey Fox. The young
doctor stopped his horse. "Come and have lunch
with us, Fox?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. But I must get to work. How long
are you going to keep Miss Warfield?"</p>

<p>"As late as we can."</p>

<p>"To-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I have a chapter ready to read to her, and you
ask her to eat with you as if she were any every-day
sort of person. Did you know that she is to play
Beatrice to my Dante?"</p>

<p>"Don't be silly," Anne said; "you mustn't listen
to him, Dr. Brooks."</p>

<p>Richard's eyes went from one to the other.
"What do you know of Fox?" he asked, as they
drove on.</p>

<p>"Nothing, except that he is writing a book."</p>

<p>"I'll ask Eve about him; she's a lion-hunter and
she's in with a lot of literary lights."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>[<a href="./images/101.png">101</a>]</span>
Even as he spoke Evelyn was speeding toward
him in Philip's car. He had forgotten her and his
invitation for the week-end. But she had not forgotten,
and she sparkled and glowed as she thought
of Richard's royal welcome. For how could she
know, as she drew near and nearer, that he was
welcoming another guest, taking off the little
teacher's old brown coat, noting the flush on her
young cheeks, the pretty appeal of her manner to
his mother.</p>

<p>"You are sure I won't be in the way, Mrs.
Brooks?"</p>

<p>"My dear, my dear, of course not. Richard has
been telling me that your grandmother was Cynthia
Warfield. Did you know that my father was in
love with Cynthia before he married my mother?"</p>

<p>"The letters said so."</p>

<p>"I shall want to see them. And to hear about
your Great-uncle Rodman. We thought at one time
that he was going to be famous, and then came that
dreadful accident."</p>

<p>They had her in a big chair now, with a high
back which peaked over her head and Nancy had
another high-backed chair, and Richard standing
on the hearth-rug surveyed the two of them contentedly.</p>

<p>"Mother, I am going to give myself fifteen minutes
right here and a half hour for lunch, and then
I'll go out and make calls, and you and Miss War<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>[<a href="./images/102.png">102</a>]</span>field
can take a nap and be ready to talk to me to-night."</p>

<p>Anne smiled up at him. "Do you always make
everybody mind?"</p>

<p>"I try to boss mother a bit&mdash;but I am not sure
that I succeed."</p>

<p>Before luncheon was served Cynthia Warfield's
picture, which hung in the library, was pointed out
to Anne. She was made to stand under it, so that
they might see that her hair was the same color&mdash;and
her eyes. Cynthia was painted in pink silk with a
petticoat of fine lace, and with pearls in her hair.</p>

<p>"Some day," Anne said, "when my ship comes
in, I am going to wear stiff pink silk and pearls and
buckled slippers and yards and yards of old lace."</p>

<p>"No, you're not," Richard told her; "you are going
to wear white with more than a million ruffles,
and little flat black shoes. Mother, you should have
seen her at Beulah Bower's party."</p>

<p>"White is always nice for a young girl," said pleasant
Nancy Brooks.</p>

<p>The dining-room looked out upon the river, with
an old-fashioned bay window curving out. The table
was placed near the window. Anne's eyes brightened
as she looked at the table. It was just as she had
pictured it, all twinkling glass and silver, and with
Richard at the head of it. But what she had not
pictured was the moment in which he stood to say
the simple and beautiful grace which his grandfather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>[<a href="./images/103.png">103</a>]</span>
had said years before in that room of many memories.</p>

<p>The act seemed to set him apart from other men.
It added dignity and strength to his youth and radiance.
He was master of a house, and he felt that
his house should have a soul!</p>

<p>Anne, writing of it the next night to her Uncle
Rod, spoke of that simple grace:</p>

<p>"Uncle Rod, it seemed to me that while most of
the world was forgetting God, he was remembering
Him. Nobody says grace at Bower's&mdash;and sometimes
I don't even say it in my heart. He looked
like a saint as he stood there with the window behind
him. Wasn't there a soldier saint&mdash;St. Michael?</p>

<p>"Could you imagine Jimmie Ford saying grace?
Could you imagine him even at the head of his own
table? When I used to think of marrying him, I
had a vision of eternal motor riding in his long blue
car&mdash;with the world rushing by in a green streak.</p>

<p>"But I am not wanting much to talk of Jimmie
Ford. Though perhaps before I finish this I shall
whisper what I thought of the things you had to say
of him in your letter.</p>

<p>"Well, after lunch I had a nap, and then there was
dinner with David Tyson in an old-fashioned dress-suit,
and Mrs. Nancy in thin black with pearls, and
St. Michael groomed and shining.</p>

<p>"It was all quite like a slice of Heaven after my
hard days nursing Peggy. We had coffee in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>[<a href="./images/104.png">104</a>]</span>
library, and then Dr. Richard and I went into the
music-room and I played for him. I sang the song
that you like about the 'Lady of the West Country':</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"&nbsp;'I think she was the most beautiful lady<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">That ever was in the West Country.<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">But beauty vanishes, beauty passes,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">However rare, rare it be;<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">And when I crumble who shall remember<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">That Lady of the West Country?'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"He liked it and made me sing it twice, and then
a dreadful thing happened. A motor stopped at
the door and some one ran up the steps. We heard
voices and turned around, and there were the Lovely
Ladies back again with the two men, and a chauffeur
in the background with the bags!</p>

<p>"It seems that they had motored down at Dr.
Richard's invitation for a week-end, and that he had
forgotten it!</p>

<p>"Of course you are asking, 'Why was it a dreadful
thing, my dear?' Uncle Rod, I stood there
smiling a welcome at them all, and Dr. Richard
said: 'You know Miss Warfield, Eve,' and then she
said, 'Oh, yes,' in a frigid fashion, and I knew by
her manner that back in her mind she was remembering
that I was the girl who had waited on the
table!</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't tell me that I mustn't feel that
way, Uncle Rod. I feel it, and feel it, and <i>feel</i> it.
How can I help feeling it when I know that if I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>[<a href="./images/105.png">105</a>]</span>
had Evelyn Chesley's friends and Evelyn's fortune,
people would look on Me-Myself in quite a different
way. You see, they would judge me by the Outside-Person
part of me, which would be soft and
silky and secure, and not dowdy and diffident.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Rod, is Geoffrey Fox right? And
have you and I been dreaming all these years? The
rest of the world doesn't dream; it makes money
and spends it, and makes money and spends it, and
makes money and spends it. Only you and I are
still old-fashioned enough to want sunsets; the rest
of them want motor cars and yachts and trips to
Europe. That was what Jimmie Ford wanted, and
that was why he didn't want me.</p>

<p>"There, I have said it, Uncle Rod. Your letter
made me know it. Perhaps I have hoped and
hoped a little that he might come back to me. <ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing word, 'I'">I</ins>
have made up scenes in my mind of how I would
scorn him and send him away, and indeed I would
send him away, for there isn't any love left&mdash;only a
lot of hurt pride.</p>

<p>"To think that he saw you and spoke to you and
didn't say one word about me. And just a year ago
at Christmas time, do you remember, Uncle Rod?
The flowers he sent, and the pearl ring&mdash;and now
the flowers are dead, and the ring went back to him.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't talk about it even to you!</p>

<p>"Well, all the evening Eve Chesley held the
center of the stage. And the funny part of it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>[<a href="./images/106.png">106</a>]</span>
that I found myself much interested in the things
she had to tell. Her life is a sort of Arabian Nights'
existence. She lives with her Aunt Maude in a big
house east of Central Park, and she told about the
green parrot for her new black and white breakfast
room, and the flame-colored fishes in an aquarium&mdash;and
she is having her opals set in platinum to go
with a silver gown that she is to wear at the Dutton-Ames
dance.</p>

<p>"I like the Dutton-Ames. He is dark and massive&mdash;a
splendid foil for his wife's slenderness and
fairness. They are much in love with each other.
He always sits beside her if he can, and she looks up
at him and smiles, and last night I saw him take her
hand where it hung among the folds of her gown,
and he held it after that&mdash;and it made me think of
father and mother&mdash;and of the way they cared.
Jimmie Ford could never care like that&mdash;but Dr.
Richard could. He cares that way for his mother&mdash;he
could care for the woman he loved.</p>

<p>"He took me home in Mr. Meade's limousine. It
was moonlight, and he told the chauffeur to drive
the long way by the river road.</p>

<p>"I like him very much. He believes in things,
and&mdash;and I rather think, that <i>his</i> ship is packed with
dreams&mdash;but I am not sure, Uncle Rod."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It was when Anne had come in from her moonlight
ride with Richard, shutting the door carefully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>[<a href="./images/107.png">107</a>]</span>
behind her, that she found Geoffrey Fox waiting for
her in the big front room.</p>

<p>"Oh," she stammered.</p>

<p>"And you really have the grace to blush? Do
you know what time it is?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Twelve! Midnight! And you have been riding
with only the chauffeur for chaperone."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"And you have kept me waiting. That's the
worst of it. You may break all of the conventional
commandments if you wish. But you mustn't keep
me waiting."</p>

<p>His laugh rang high, his cheeks were flushed.
Anne had never seen him in a mood like this. In
his loose coat with a flowing black tie and with his
ruffled hair curling close about his ears, he looked
boyish and handsome like the pictures she had seen
of Byron in an old book.</p>

<p>"Sit down, sit down," he was insisting; "now
that you are here, you must listen."</p>

<p>"It is too late," she demurred, "and we'll wake
everybody up."</p>

<p>"No, we shan't. The doors are shut. I saw to
that. We are as much alone as if we were in a
desert. And I can't sleep until I have read that
chapter to you&mdash;please&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Reluctantly, with her wraps on, she sat down.</p>

<p>"Take off your hat."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>[<a href="./images/108.png">108</a>]</span>
He stood over her while she removed it, and
helped her out of her coat "Look at me," he
said, peremptorily. "I hate to read to wandering
eyes."</p>

<p>He threw himself into a chair and began:</p>

<p>"<i>So they marched away&mdash;young Franz from Nuremberg
and young George from London, and Michel
straight from the vineyards on the coast of France.</i>"</p>

<p>That was the beginning of Geoffrey Fox's famous
story: "The Three Souls," the story which was to
bring him something of fortune as well as of fame,
the story which had been suggested to Anne Warfield
by the staring eyes of Peggy's pussy cat.</p>

<p>As she listened, Anne saw three youths starting
out from home, marching gaily through the cities
and steadily along the roads&mdash;marching, marching&mdash;Franz
from Nuremburg, young George from London,
and Michel from his sunlighted vineyards,
drawing close and closer, unconscious of the fate
that was bringing them together, thinking of the
glory of battle, and of the honor of Kaiser and King
and of the Republic.</p>

<p>The shadow of the great conflict falls gradually
upon them. They meet the wounded, the refugees,
they hear the roar of the guns, they listen to the
tales of those who have been in the thick of it.</p>

<p>Then come privations, suffering, winter in the
trenches&mdash;Franz on one side, young George on the
other, and Michel; then fighting&mdash;fear&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>[<a href="./images/109.png">109</a>]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>Geoffrey stopped there. "Shall I have them
afraid?"</p>

<p>"I think they would be afraid. But they would
keep on fighting, and that would be heroic."</p>

<p>She added, "How well you do it!"</p>

<p>"This part is easy. It will be the last of it that
I shall find hard&mdash;when I deal with their souls."</p>

<p>"Oh, you must show at the last that it is because
of their souls that they are brothers. Each man has
had a home, he has had love, each of them has had
his hopes and dreams for the future, for his middle-age
and his old age, and now there is to be no
middle-age, no old age&mdash;and in their knowledge of
their common lot their hatred dies."</p>

<p>"I am afraid I can't do it," he said, moodily. "I
should have to swing myself out into an atmosphere
which I have never breathed."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I am of the earth&mdash;earthy. I have sold my
birthright, I have yearned for the flesh-pots, I have
fed among&mdash;swine. I have done all of the other
things which haven't Biblical sanction. And now
you expect me to write of souls."</p>

<p>"I expect you to give to the world your best.
You speak of your talent as if it were a little thing.
And it is not a little thing."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I mean that it is&mdash;God given."</p>

<p>Out of a long silence he said: "I thank you for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>[<a href="./images/110.png">110</a>]</span>
saying that. Nobody has ever said such a thing to
me before."</p>

<p>He let her go then. And as she stood before her
door a little later and whispered, "Good-night," he
caught her hand and held it. "Mistress Anne&mdash;will
you remember me&mdash;now and then&mdash;in your little
white prayers?"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3><i>In Which a Green-Eyed Monster Grips Eve.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn</span>, coming down late on the morning
after her unexpected arrival, asked: "How did
you happen to have her here, Dicky?"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"The little waitress?"</p>

<p>"Eve&mdash;&mdash;" warningly.</p>

<p>"Well, then, the little school-teacher."</p>

<p>"Since when did you become a snob, Eve?"</p>

<p>"Don't be so sharp about it, Dicky. I'm not a
snob. But you must admit that it was rather surprising
to find her here, when the last time I saw
her she was passing things at the Bower's table."</p>

<p>"She is a granddaughter of Cynthia Warfield."</p>

<p>"Who's Cynthia? I never heard of her."</p>

<p>"You have seen her portrait in our library."</p>

<p>"Which portrait?"</p>

<p>He led the way and showed it to her. Eve,
looking at it thoughtfully, remarked, "Why should
a girl like that lower herself by serving&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"She probably doesn't feel that she can lower herself
by anything. She is what she is."</p>

<p>She shrugged. "You know as well as I that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>[<a href="./images/112.png">112</a>]</span>
people can't do such things&mdash;and get away with it.
She may be very nice and all that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She is nice."</p>

<p>"Well, don't lose your temper over it, and don't
fall in love with her, Dicky."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Haven't you done enough foolish things without
doing&mdash;that?"</p>

<p>"Doing what?" ominously.</p>

<p>"Oh, you know what I mean," impatiently.
"Aren't you ever going to come to your senses,
Dicky?"</p>

<p>"Suppose we don't talk of it, Eve."</p>

<p>She found herself wanting to talk of it. She
wanted to rage and rant. She was astonished at
the primitiveness of her emotions. She had laughed
her way through life and had prided herself on the
dispassionateness of her point of view. And now it
was only by the exercise of the utmost self-control
that she was able to swing the conversation toward
other topics.</p>

<p>The coming of the rest of the party eased things
up a little. They had all slept late, and Richard
had made a half dozen calls before he had joined
Eve in the Garden Room. He had stopped at
David's, and had heard that on Monday there was
to be a drag-hunt and breakfast at the club. David
hoped they would all stay over for it.</p>

<p>"Cousin David has a bunch of weedy-looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>[<a href="./images/113.png">113</a>]</span>
hounds," Richard explained; "he lets them run as
they please, and they've been getting up a fox nearly
every night. He thought you might like to ride up
to the ridge in the moonlight and have a view of
them. I can get you some pretty fair mounts at
Bower's."</p>

<p>There was a note of wistful appeal in Eve's voice.
"Do you really want us, Dicky?"</p>

<p>He smiled at her. "Of course. Don't be silly,
Eve."</p>

<p>She saw that she was forgiven, and smiled back.
She had not slept much the night before. She had
heard Richard come in after his ride with Anne, and
she had been waked later by the sound of the telephone.
In the room next to hers Richard's subdued
voice had answered. And presently there had been
the sound of his careful footsteps on the stairs.</p>

<p>She had crept out of bed and between the curtains
had looked out. The world was full of the shadowy
paleness which comes with the waning of the moon.
The road beyond the garden showed like a dull gray
ribbon against the blackness of the hills. On this
road appeared presently Richard on his big white
horse, the dog Toby, a shadow among the shadows
as he ran on ahead of them.</p>

<p>On and on they sped up the dull gray road, a
spectral rider on a spectral horse. She had wondered
where he might be going. It must have been
some sudden and urgent call to take him out thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>[<a href="./images/114.png">114</a>]</span>
in the middle of the night. For the first time she
realized what his life meant. He could never really
be at his ease. Always there was before him the
possibility of some dread adventure&mdash;death might
be on its way at this very moment.</p>

<p>Wide-awake and wrapped in her great rug, she
had waited, and after a time Richard had returned.
The dawn was rising on the hills, and the world was
pink. His head was up and he was urging his
horse to a swift gallop.</p>

<p>When at last he reached his room, she had gone
to bed. But when she slept it was to dream that
the man on the white horse was riding away from
her, and that when she called he would not come.</p>

<p>But now with his smile upon her, she decided that
she was making too much of it all. The affair with
the little school-teacher might not be in the least
serious. Men had their fancies, and Dicky was not
a fool.</p>

<p>She knew her power over him, and her charm.
His little boyhood had been heavy with sorrow and
soberness; she had lightened it by her gaiety and
good nature. Eve had taken her orphaned state
philosophically. Her parents had died before she
knew them. Her Aunt Maude was rich and gave
her everything; she was queen of her small domain.
Richard, on the other hand, had been early oppressed
by anxieties&mdash;his care for his strong little
mother, his real affection for his weak father, cul<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>[<a href="./images/115.png">115</a>]</span>minating
in the tragedy which had come during his
college days. In all the years Eve had been his
good comrade and companion. She had cheered
him, commanded him, loved him.</p>

<p>And he had loved her. He had never analyzed
the quality of his love. She was his good friend,
his sister. If he had ever thought of her as his
sweetheart or as his wife, it had always been with
the feeling that Eve had too much money. No man
had a right to live on his wife's bounty.</p>

<p>He had a genuinely happy day with her. He
showed her the charming old house which she had
never seen. He showed her the schoolhouse, still
closed on account of the epidemic. He showed her
the ancient ballroom built out in a separate wing.</p>

<p>"A little money would make it lovely, Richard."</p>

<p>"It is lovely without the money."</p>

<p>Winifred Ames spoke earnestly from the window
where, with her husband's arm about her, she was
observing the sunset. "Some day Tony and I are
going to have a house like this&mdash;and then we'll be
happy."</p>

<p>"Aren't you happy now?" her husband demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes. But not on my own plan, as it were."
Then softly so that no one else could hear, "I want
just you, Tony&mdash;and all the rest of the world away."</p>

<p>"Dear Heart&mdash;&mdash;" He dared not say more, for
Pip's envious eyes were upon them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>[<a href="./images/116.png">116</a>]</span>
"When I marry you, Eve, may I hold your hand
in public?"</p>

<p>"You may&mdash;when I marry you."</p>

<p>"Good. Whenever I lose faith in the bliss of
matrimony, I have only to look at Win and Tony
to be cheered and sustained by their example."</p>

<p>Nancy, playing the little lovely hostess, agreed.
"If they weren't so new-fashioned in every way I
should call them an old-fashioned couple."</p>

<p>"Love is never out of fashion, Mrs. Nancy," said
Eve; "is it, Dicky Boy?"</p>

<p>"Ask Pip."</p>

<p>"Love," said Philip solemnly, "is the newest
thing in the world and the oldest. Each lover is a
Columbus discovering an unknown continent."</p>

<p>In the hall the old clock chimed. "Nobody is to
dress for dinner," Richard said, "if we are to ride
afterward. I'll telephone for the horses."</p>

<p>He telephoned and rode down later on his big
Ben to bring the horses up. As he came into the
yard at Bower's he saw a light in the old stable.
Dismounting, he went to the open door. Anne was
with Diogenes. The lantern was set on the step
above her, and she was feeding the old drake. Her
body was in the shadow, her face luminous. Yet
it was a sober little face, set with tired lines. Looking
at her, Richard reached a sudden determination.</p>

<p>He would ask her to ride with them to the ridge.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>[<a href="./images/117.png">117</a>]</span>
At the sound of his voice she turned and her face
changed. "Did I startle you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," she smiled at him. "Only I was thinking
about you, and there you were." There was no
coquetry in her tone; she stated the fact frankly and
simply. "Do you remember how you put Toby in
here, and how Diogenes hated it?"</p>

<p>"I remember how you looked under the lantern."</p>

<p>"Oh,"&mdash;she had not expected that,&mdash;"do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But I had seen you before. You were
standing on a rock with holly in your arms. I saw
you from the train throw something into the river.
I have often wondered what it was."</p>

<p>"I didn't want to burn my holly wreaths after
Christmas. I hate to burn things that have been
alive."</p>

<p>"So do I. Eve would say that we were sentimentalists.
But I have never quite been able to see
why a sentimentalist isn't quite as worthy of respect
as a materialist&mdash;however, I am not here to argue
that. I want you to ride with me to the ridge. To
see the foxes by moonlight," he further elucidated.
"Run in and get ready. I am to take some horses
up for the others."</p>

<p>She rose and reached for her lantern. "The
others?" she looked an inquiry over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Eve and her crowd. They are still at Crossroads."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>[<a href="./images/118.png">118</a>]</span>
She stood irresolute. Then, "I think I'd rather
not go."</p>

<p>"Why not?" sharply.</p>

<p>She told him the truth bravely. "I am a little
afraid of women like that."</p>

<p>"Of Eve and Winifred? Why?"</p>

<p>"We are people of two worlds, Dr. Brooks&mdash;and
they feel it."</p>

<p>His conversation with Eve recurring to him, he
was not prepared to argue. But he was prepared to
have his own way.</p>

<p>"Isn't your world mine?" he demanded. "And
you mustn't mind Eve. She's all right when you
know her. Just stiffen your backbone, and remember
that you are the granddaughter of Cynthia
Warfield."</p>

<p>After that she gave in and came down presently
in a shabby little habit with her hair tied with a
black bow. "It's a good thing it is dark," she said.
"I haven't any up-to-date clothes."</p>

<p>As they went along he asked her to go to the
hunt breakfast on Monday.</p>

<p>"I can't. School opens and my work begins."</p>

<p>"By Jove, I had forgotten. I shall be glad to
hear the bell. When I am riding over the hills it
seems to call&mdash;as it called to my grandfather and to
be saying the same things; it is a great inspiration
to have a background like that to one's life. Do
you know what I mean?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>[<a href="./images/119.png">119</a>]</span>
She did know, and they talked about it&mdash;these two
young and eager souls to whom life spoke of things
to be done, and done well.</p>

<p>Eve, standing on the steps at Crossroads, saw
them coming. "Oh, I'm not going," she said to
Winifred passionately.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"He has that girl with him."</p>

<p>"What girl?"</p>

<p>"Anne Warfield."</p>

<p>Winifred's eyes opened wide. "She's a darling,
Eve. I liked her so much last night."</p>

<p>"I don't see why he has to bring her into everything."</p>

<p>"All the men are in love with her; even Tony has
eyes for her, and Pip&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What makes you defend her, Win? She isn't
one of us, and you know it."</p>

<p>"I don't know it. She belongs to older stock
than either you or I, Eve. And if she didn't, don't
you know a lady when you see one?"</p>

<p>Eve threw up her hands. "I sometimes think
the world is going mad&mdash;there aren't any more lines
drawn."</p>

<p>"If there were," said Winifred softly, and perhaps
a bit maliciously, "I fancy that Anne Warfield might
be the one to draw them&mdash;and leave us on the wrong
side, Eve."</p>

<p>It was Winifred who welcomed Anne, and who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>[<a href="./images/120.png">120</a>]</span>
rode beside her later, and it was of Winifred that
Anne spoke repentantly as she and Richard rode
together in the hills. "I want to take back the
things I said about Mrs. Ames. She is just&mdash;heavenly
sweet."</p>

<p>He smiled. "I knew you would like her," he
said. But neither of them mentioned Eve.</p>

<p>For Evelyn's manner had been insufferable. Anne
might have been a shadow on the grass, a cloud
across the sky, a stone in the road for all the notice
she had taken of her. It was a childish thing to do,
but then Eve was childish. And she was having
the novel experience of being overlooked for the first
time by Richard. She was aware, too, that she had
offended him deeply and that the cause of her offending
was another woman.</p>

<p>When they came to the ridge Richard drew Anne's
horse, with his own, among the trees. He left Eve
to Pip. Winifred and her husband were with David.</p>

<p>Far off in the distance a steady old hound gave
tongue&mdash;then came the music of the pack&mdash;the
swift silent figure of the fox, straight across the open
moonlighted space in front of them.</p>

<p>Anne gave a little gasp. "It is old Pete," Richard
murmured; "they'll never catch him. I'll tell you
about him on the way down."</p>

<p>So as he rode beside her after that perfect hour in
which the old fox played with the tumultuous pack,
at his ease, monarch of his domain, unmindful of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>[<a href="./images/121.png">121</a>]</span>
silent watchers in the shadows, Richard told her of old
Pete; he told her, too, of the traditions of a ghostly
fox who now and then troubled the hounds, leading
them into danger and sometimes to death.</p>

<p>He went on with her to Bower's, and when he
left her he handed her a feathery bit of pine. "I
picked it on the ridge," he said. "I don't know
whether you feel as I do about the scrub pines of
Maryland and of Virginia; somehow they seem to
belong, as you and I do, to this country."</p>

<p>When Anne went to her room she stuck the bit
of pine in her mirror. Then in an uplifted mood
she wrote to Uncle Rod. But she said little to him
of Richard or of Eve. Her own feelings were too
mixed in the matter to permit of analysis. But she
told of the fox in the moonlight. "And the loveliest
part of it all was that nothing happened to him. I
don't think that I could have stood it to have had
him killed. He was so free&mdash;and unafraid&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The next night Anne in the long front room at
Bower's told Peggy and Fran&ccedil;ois all about it.
Fran&ccedil;ois' mother was sewing for Mrs. Bower, and as
the distance was great, and she could not go home
at night, her small son was sharing with her the
hospitality which seemed to him rich and royal in
comparison with the economies practised in his own
small home.</p>

<p>It was a select company which was gathered in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>[<a href="./images/122.png">122</a>]</span>
front of the fire. Fran&ccedil;ois and Peggy and Anne and
old Mamie, with the white house cat, Josephine, and
three kittens in a basket, and Brinsley Tyson smoking
his pipe in the background.</p>

<p>"And the old fox went tit-upping and tit-upping
along the road in the moonlight, and Dr. Richard
and I stood very still, and we saw him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Last night?"</p>

<p>Anne nodded.</p>

<p>"And what did you do, Miss Anne?"</p>

<p>"We listened and heard the dogs&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Little Fran&ccedil;ois clasped his hands. "Oh, were the
dogs after him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did they get him?"</p>

<p>"No. He is a wise old fox. He lives up beyond
the Crossroads garden. Dr. Brooks thought when
they came there to live that he would go away but
he hasn't. You see, it is his home. The hunters
here all know him, and they are always glad when
he gets away."</p>

<p>Brinsley agreed. "There are so few native foxes
left in the county that most of us call off the dogs
before a killing&mdash;we'd soon be without sport if we
didn't. An imported fox is a creature in a trap; you
want the sly old natives to give you a run for your
money."</p>

<p>Little Fran&ccedil;ois, dark-eyed and dreamy, delivered
an energetic opinion. "I think it is horrid."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>[<a href="./images/123.png">123</a>]</span>
Peggy, less sensitive, and of the country, reproved
him. "It's gentleman's sport, isn't it, Mr. Brinsley?"</p>

<p>"Yes. To me the dogs and horses are the best
part of it. The older I grow the more I hate to kill&mdash;that's
why I fish. They are cold-blooded creatures."</p>

<p>Peggy, leaning on his knee, demanded a fish story.
"The one you told us the last time."</p>

<p>Brinsley's fish story was a poem written by one of
the Old Gentlemen, hunting now, it was to be hoped,
in happier fields. It was an idyl of the Chesapeake:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In the Chesapeake and its tribute streams,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">Where broadening out to the bay they come,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">And the great fresh waters meet the brine,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">There lives a fish that is called the drum."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The drum fish and an old negro, Ned, were the
actors in the drama. Ned, fishing one day in his
dug-out canoe,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Tied his line to his ankle tight,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">To be ready to haul if the fish should bite,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">And seized his fiddle&mdash;&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He played:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But slower and slower he drew the bow,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">And soft grew the music sweet and low,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">The lids fell wearily over the eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">The bow arm stopped and the melodies.<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">The last strain melted along the deep,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">And Ned, the old fisherman, sank to sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">Just then a huge drum, sent hither by fate,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">Caught a passing glimpse of the tempting bait. . . .<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>[<a href="./images/124.png">124</a>]</span><br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">. . . . One terrible jerk of wrath and dread<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">From the wounded fish as away he sped<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">With a strength by rage made double&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">And into the water went old Ned.<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">No time for any 'last words' to be said,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">For the waves settled placidly over his head,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">And his last remark was a bubble."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The children's eyes were wide. Peggy was entranced,
but Fran&ccedil;ois was not so sure that he liked
it. Brinsley's hand dropped on the little lad's shoulder
as he told how the two were found</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"So looped and tangled together<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">That their fate was involved in a dark mystery<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">As to which was the catcher and which the catchee . . .<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">And the fishermen thought it could never be known<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">After all their thinking and figuring,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">Whether the nigger a-fishing had gone,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">Or the fish had gone out a-niggering."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There were defects in meter and rhythm, but
Brinsley's sprightly delivery made these of minor
importance, and the company had no criticism.
Fran&ccedil;ois, shivering a little, admitted that he wanted
to hear it again, and climbed to Brinsley's knee.
The old man with his arm about him decided that to
say it over would be to spoil the charm, and that
anyhow the time had come to pop the corn.</p>

<p>To Fran&ccedil;ois this was a new art, but when he had
followed the fascinating process through all its stages
until the white grains boiled up in the popper and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>[<a href="./images/125.png">125</a>]</span>
threatened to burst the cover, his rapture knew no
bounds.</p>

<p>"Could I do it myself, Miss Anne?" he asked,
and she let him empty the snowy kernels into a big
bowl, and fill the popper for a second supply.</p>

<p>She bent above him, showing him how to shake it
steadily.</p>

<p>Geoffrey Fox coming in smiled at the scene.
How far away it seemed from anything modern&mdash;this
wide hearth-stone with the dog and the pussy
cat&mdash;and the little children, the lovely girl and the
old man&mdash;the wind blowing outside&mdash;the corn popping
away like little pistols.</p>

<p>"May I have some?" he asked, and Anne smiled
up at him, while Peggy brought little plates and set
the big bowl on a stool within reach of them all.</p>

<p>"What brings you up, sir?" Geoffrey asked
Brinsley.</p>

<p>"The drag-hunt and breakfast at the club. I am
too stiff to follow, but David and I like to meet old
friends&mdash;you see I was born in this country."</p>

<p>That was the beginning of a string of reminiscences
to which they all listened breathlessly. The
fox hunting instinct was an inheritance in this part
of the country. It had its traditions and legends
and Brinsley knew them all.</p>

<p>If any one had told Geoffrey Fox a few weeks
before that he would be content to spend his time as
he was spending it now, writing all day and reading<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>[<a href="./images/126.png">126</a>]</span>
the chapters at night to a serious-eyed little school-teacher
who scolded him and encouraged him by
turns, he would have scoffed at such an impossible
prospect. Yet he was not only doing it, but was
glad to be swept away from the atmosphere of somewhat
sordid Bohemianism with which he had in
these later years been surrounded.</p>

<p>And as Brinsley talked, Geoffrey watched Anne.
She had Peggy in her arms. Such women were
made, he felt, to be not only the mothers of children,
but the mothers of the men they loved&mdash;made for
brooding tenderness&mdash;to inspire&mdash;to sympathize.</p>

<p>Yet with all her gentleness he knew that Anne was
a strong little thing. She would never be a clinging
vine; she was rather like a rose high on a trellis&mdash;a
man must reach up to draw her to him.</p>

<p>As she glanced up, he smiled at her, and she
smiled back. Then the smile froze.</p>

<p>Framed in the front doorway stood Eve Chesley!
She came straight to Anne and held out her hand.
"I made Richard bring me down," she said. "I
want to talk to you about the Crossroads ball."</p>

<p>Eve repentant was Eve in her most charming
mood. On Sunday morning she had apologized to
Richard. "I was horrid, Dicky."</p>

<p>"Last night? You were. I wouldn't have believed
it of you, Eve."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, don't be a prig. Do you remember
how we used to make up after a quarrel?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>[<a href="./images/127.png">127</a>]</span>
He laughed. "We had to go down on our
knees."</p>

<p>She went down on hers, sinking slowly and gracefully
to the floor. "Please, I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"Eve, will you ever grow up?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to grow up," wistfully. "Dicky,
do you remember that after I had said I was sorry
you always bought chocolate drops, and made me
eat them all. You were such a good little boy,
Richard."</p>

<p>"I was not," hotly.</p>

<p>"Why is it that men don't like to be told that
they were good little boys? You are a good little
boy now."</p>

<p>"I'm not."</p>

<p>"You are&mdash;and you are tied to your mother's
apron strings."</p>

<p>"Dicky," she wailed, as he rose in wrath, "I
didn't mean that. Honestly. And I'll be good."</p>

<p>Still, with her feet tucked under her, she sat on
the floor. "I've been thinking&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Eve."</p>

<p>"You and I have a birthday in March. Why
can't we have a big house-warming, and ask all the
county families and a lot of people from town?"</p>

<p>"I'm not a millionaire, Eve."</p>

<p>"Neither am I. But there's always Aunt Maude."</p>

<p>She spread out her hands, palms upward. "All I
shall have to do is to wheedle her a bit, and she'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>[<a href="./images/128.png">128</a>]</span>
give it to me for a birthday present. Please, Dicky.
If you say 'yes' I'll go down to Bower's my very
own self and ask Anne Warfield to come to our
ball."</p>

<p>He stared at her incredulously. "You'll do
<i>what</i>?"</p>

<p>"Ask your little&mdash;school-teacher. Win scolded me
last night, and said that I was a selfish pig. That I
couldn't expect to keep you always to myself. But
you see I have kept you, Dicky. I have always
thought that you and I could go on being&mdash;friends,
with no one to break in on it."</p>

<p>Her eyes as she raised them to his were shadowed.
He spoke heartily. "My dear girl, as if anything
could ever come between us." He rose and drew
her up from her lowly seat. "I'm glad we talked it
out. I confess I was feeling pretty sore over the
way you acted, Eve. It wasn't like you."</p>

<p>Eve stuck to her resolution to go to Bower's
to seek out and conciliate Anne, and thus it happened
that they found her making a Madonna of
herself with Peggy in her arms, and Geoffrey Fox's
eyes adoring her.</p>

<p>Little Fran&ccedil;ois told his mother later that at first he
had thought the lovely lady was a fairy princess; for
Eve was quite sumptuous in her dinner gown of
white and shining satin, with a fur-trimmed wrap
of white and silver. She wore, also, a princess air
of graciousness, quite different from the half appeal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>[<a href="./images/129.png">129</a>]</span>ing
impertinence of her morning mood when she had
knelt at Richard's feet.</p>

<p>Anne, appeased and fascinated by the warmth of
Eve's manner, found herself drawn in spite of herself
to the charming creature who discussed so frankly
her plans for their pleasure.</p>

<p>"Dicky and I were born on the same day," she
explained, "and we always have a party together,
with two cakes with candles, and this year it is to be
at Crossroads."</p>

<p>She invited Brinsley and Geoffrey on the spot,
and promised the children a peep into fairy-land.
Then having settled the matter to the satisfaction of
all concerned, she demanded a fresh popper of corn,
insisted on a repetition of Brinsley's fish story, asked
about Geoffrey's book, and went away leaving behind
her a trail of laughter and light-heartedness.</p>

<p>Later Anne was aware that she had left also a feeling
of bewilderment. It seemed incredible that the
distance between the mood of last night and of to-night
should have been bridged so successfully.</p>

<p>Brushing her hair in front of the mirror, she asked
herself, "How much of it was real friendliness?"
Uncle Rod had a proverb, "'<i>A false friend has
honey in his mouth, gall in his heart.</i>'"</p>

<p>She chided herself for her mistrust. One must not
inquire too much into motives.</p>

<p>The sight of Richard's bit of pine in the mirror
frame shed a gleam of naturalness across the strange<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>[<a href="./images/130.png">130</a>]</span>ness
of the hour just spent. It seemed to say, "You
and I of the country&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Eve was of the town!</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The weeks which followed were rare ones. Anne
went forth joyous in the morning, and came home
joyous at night. She saw Richard daily; now on
the road, again in the schoolhouse, less often, but
most satisfyingly, by the fire at Bower's.</p>

<p>Geoffrey, noting jealously these evenings that
the young doctor spent in the long front room, at
last spoke his mind.</p>

<p>"What makes you look like that?" he demanded,
as having watched Richard safely out of the way
from an upper window, he came down to find Anne
gazing dreamily into the coals.</p>

<p>"Like what?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a sort of seventh-heaven look."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean."</p>

<p>"You won't admit that you know what I mean."</p>

<p>She rose.</p>

<p>"Sit down. I want to read to you."</p>

<p>"I am afraid I haven't time."</p>

<p>"You had time for Brooks. If you don't let me
read to you I shall have to sit all alone&mdash;in the
dark&mdash;my eyes are hurting me."</p>

<p>"Why don't you ask Dr. Brooks about your
eyes?"</p>

<p>"Is Dr. Brooks the oracle?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>[<a href="./images/131.png">131</a>]</span>
"He could tell you about your eyes."</p>

<p>"Does he tell you about yours?"</p>

<p>With a scornful glance she left him, but he followed
her. "Why shouldn't he tell you about your
eyes? They are lovely eyes, Mistress Anne."</p>

<p>"I hate to have you talk like that. It seems to
separate me in some way from your friendship, and
I thought we were friends."</p>

<p>Her gentleness conquered his mad mood. "Oh,
you little saint, you little saint, and I am such a
sinner."</p>

<p>So they patched it up, and he read to her the last
chapter of his book.</p>

<p>"<i>And now in the darkness they lay dying, young
Franz from Nuremberg, and young George from
London, and Michel straight from the vineyards on
the coast of France.</i>"</p>

<p>In the darkness they spoke of their souls. Soon
they would go out into the Great Beyond. What
then, after death? Franz thought they might go
marching on. Young George had a vision of green
fields and of hawthorn hedges. But it was young
Michel who spoke of the face of God.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Was this the Geoffrey who had teased her on the
stairs? This man who wrote words which made one
shake and shiver and sob?</p>

<p>"Oh, how do you do it, how do you do it?" The
tears were running down her cheeks.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>[<a href="./images/132.png">132</a>]</span>
She saw him then as people rarely saw Geoffrey
Fox. "God knows," he said, seriously, "but I think
that your prayers have helped."</p>

<p>And after she had gone up-stairs he sat long by
the fire, alone, with his hand shading his eyes.</p>

<p>The next morning he went to see Richard. The
young doctor was in the Garden Room which he
used as an office. It was on the ground floor of the
big house, with a deer's horns over the fireplace, an
ancient desk in one corner, a sideboard against the
north wall. In days gone by this room had served
many purposes. Here men in hunting pink had
gathered for the gay breakfasts which were to fortify
them for their sport. On the sideboard mighty
roasts had been carved, and hot dishes had steamed.
On the round table had been set forth bottles and
glasses on Sheffield trays. Men ate much and rode
hard. They had left to their descendants a divided
heritage of indigestion and of strong sinews, to make
of it what they could.</p>

<p>Geoffrey entering asked at once, "Why the
Garden Room? There is no garden."</p>

<p>"There was a garden," Richard told him, "but
there is a tradition that a pair of lovers eloped
over the wall, and the irate father destroyed every
flower, every shrub, as if the garden had betrayed
him."</p>

<p>"There's a story in that. Did the girl ever come
back to find the garden dead?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>[<a href="./images/133.png">133</a>]</span>
"Who knows?" Richard said lightly; "and now,
what's the matter with your eyes?"</p>

<p>There was much the matter, and when Richard
had made a thorough examination he spoke of a
specialist. "Have you ever had trouble with them
before?"</p>

<p>"Once, when I was a youngster. I thought I was
losing my sight. I used to open my eyes in the
dark and think that the curse had come upon me.
My grandfather was blind."</p>

<p>"It is rarely inherited, and not in this form. But
there might be a predisposition. Anyhow, you'll
have to stop work for a time."</p>

<p>"I can't stop work. My book is in the last chapters.
And it is a great book. I've never written a
great book before. I can talk freely to you, doctor.
You know that we artists can't help our egotism.
It's a disease that is easily diagnosed."</p>

<p>Richard laughed. "What's the name of your
book?"</p>

<p>"'Three Souls.' Anne Warfield gave me the
theme."</p>

<p>As he spoke her name it was like a living flame
between them. Richard tried to answer naturally.
"She ought to be able to write books herself."</p>

<p>Geoffrey shrugged. "She will live her life stories,
not write them."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because we men don't let such women live their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>[<a href="./images/134.png">134</a>]</span>
own lives. We demand their service and the inspiration
of their sympathy. And so we won't let
them achieve. We make them light our torches.
We are selfish beasts, you know, in the last analysis."</p>

<p>He laughed and rose. "I'll see a specialist. But
nobody shall make me stop writing. Not till I have
scribbled 'Finis' to my manuscript."</p>

<p>"It isn't well to defy nature."</p>

<p>"Defiance is better than submission. Nature's a
cruel jade. You know that. In the end she gets us
all. That's why I hate the country. It's there that
we see Nature unmasked. I stayed three weeks at
a farm last summer, and from morning to night
murder went on. A cat killed a cardinal, and a blue
jay killed a grosbeak. One of the servants shot a
squirrel. And when I walked out one morning to
see the sheep, a lamb was gone and we had a roast
with mint sauce for dinner. For lunch we had the
squirrel in a stew. A hawk swept down upon the
chickens, and all that escaped we ate later fried,
with cream gravy."</p>

<p>"In most of your instances man was the offender."</p>

<p>"Well, if man didn't kill, something else would.
For every lamb there's a wolf."</p>

<p>"You are looking on only one side of it."</p>

<p>"When you can show me the other I'll believe in
it. But not to-day when you tell me that my sun
may be blotted out."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>[<a href="./images/135.png">135</a>]</span>
Something in his voice made the young doctor
lay his hand on his shoulder and say quietly: "My
dear fellow, don't begin to dread that which may
never come. There should be years of light before
you. Only you'll have to be careful."</p>

<p>They stood now in the door of the Garden Room.
The sun was shining, the snow was melting. There
was the acrid smell of box from the hedge beyond.</p>

<p>"I hate caution," said young Geoffrey; "I want
to do as I please."</p>

<p>"So does every man," said Richard, "but life
teaches him that he can't."</p>

<p>"Oh, Life," scoffed Geoffrey Fox; "life isn't a
school. It is a joy ride, with rocks ahead."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3><i>In Which Anne, Passing a Shop, Turns In.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Anne</span> had the Crossroads ball much on her
mind. She spoke to Beulah about it.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to wear."</p>

<p>"You'd better go to town with me on Saturday
and look for something."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I will. If I had plenty of money it
would be easy. Beulah, did you ever see such
clothes as Eve Chesley's?"</p>

<p>"If I could spend as much as she does, I'd make
more of a show."</p>

<p>"Think of all the tailors and dressmakers and
dancing masters and hair-dressers it has taken to
make Eve what she is. And yet all the art is
hidden."</p>

<p>"I don't think it is hidden. I saw her powder her
nose right in front of the men that day she first
came. She had a little gold case with a mirror in
it, and while Dr. Brooks and Mr. Fox were sitting
on the stairs with her, she took it out and looked at
herself and rubbed some rouge on her cheeks."</p>

<p>Anne had a vision of the three of them sitting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>[<a href="./images/137.png">137</a>]</span>
on the stairs. "Well," she said, in a fierce little
fashion, "I don't know what the world is coming
to."</p>

<p>Beulah cared little about Eve's world. For the
moment Eric filled her horizon, and the dress she
was to get to make herself pretty for him.</p>

<p>"Shall we go Saturday?" she asked.</p>

<p>Anne, rummaging in the drawer of her desk,
produced a small and shabby pocketbook. She
shook the money out and counted it. "With the
check that Uncle Rod sent me," she said, "there's
enough for a really lovely frock. But I don't know
whether I ought to spend it."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Everybody ought to save something&mdash;I am
teaching my children to have penny banks&mdash;and
yet I go on spending and spending with nothing to
show for it."</p>

<p>Beulah was quite placid. "I don't see why you
should save. Some day you will get married, and
then you won't have to."</p>

<p>"If a woman marries a poor man she ought to be
careful of finances. She has to think of her children
and of their future."</p>

<p>Beulah shrugged. "What's the use of looking so
far ahead? And 'most any husband will see that his
wife doesn't get too much to spend."</p>

<p>Before Anne went to bed that night she put a part
of her small store of money into a separate compart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>[<a href="./images/138.png">138</a>]</span>ment
of her purse. She would buy a cheaper frock
and save herself the afterpangs of extravagance.
And the penny banks of the children would no
longer accuse her of inconsistency!</p>

<p>The shopping expedition proved a strenuous one.
Anne had fixed her mind on certain things which
proved to be too expensive. "You go for your
fitting," she said to Beulah desperately, as the afternoon
waned, "and I will take a last look up Charles
Street. We can meet at the train."</p>

<p>The way which she had to travel was a familiar
one, but its charm held her&mdash;the street lights glimmered
pale gold in the early dusk, the crowd swung
along in its brisk city manner toward home. Beyond
the shops was the Cardinal's house. The Monument
topped the hill; to its left the bronze lions guarded
the great square; to the right there was the thin
spire of the Methodist Church.</p>

<p>She had an hour before train time and she lingered
a little, stopping at this window and that, and all the
time the money which she had elected to save burned
a hole in her pocket.</p>

<p>For there were such things to buy! Passing a
flower shop there were violets and roses. Passing
a candy shop were chocolates. Passing a hat shop
there was a veil flung like a cloud over a celestial <i>chapeau</i>!
Passing an Everything-that-is-Lovely shop
she saw an enchanting length of silk&mdash;as pink as a
sea-shell&mdash;silk like that which Cynthia Warfield had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>[<a href="./images/139.png">139</a>]</span>
worn when she sat for the portrait which hung in
the library at Crossroads!</p>

<p>Anne did not pass the Lovely Shop; she turned
and went in, and bought ten yards of silk with the
money that she had meant to spend&mdash;and the money
she had meant to save!</p>

<p>And she missed the train!</p>

<p>Beulah was waiting for her as she came in breathless.
"There isn't another train for two hours," she
complained.</p>

<p>Anne sank down on a bench. "I am sorry,
Beulah. I didn't know it was so late."</p>

<p>"We'll have to get supper in the station," Beulah
said, "and I have spent all my money."</p>

<p>"Oh, and I've spent mine." Anne reflected that
if she had not bought the silk she could have paid
for Beulah's supper. But she was glad that she had
bought it, and that she had it under her arm in a
neat package.</p>

<p>She dug into her slim purse and produced a dime.
"Never mind, Beulah, we can buy some chocolates."</p>

<p>But they were not destined for such meager fare.
Rushing into the station came Geoffrey Fox. As he
saw the clock he stopped with the air of a man
baffled by fate.</p>

<p>Anne moving toward him across the intervening
space saw his face change.</p>

<p>"By all that's wonderful," he said, "how did this
happen?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>[<a href="./images/140.png">140</a>]</span>
"We missed our train."</p>

<p>"And I missed mine. Who is 'we'?"</p>

<p>"Beulah is with me."</p>

<p>"Can't you both have dinner with me somewhere?
There are two hours of waiting ahead of us."</p>

<p>Anne demurred. "I'm not very hungry."</p>

<p>But Beulah, who had joined them, was hungry,
and she said so, frankly. "I am starved. If I could
have just a sandwich&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You shall have more than that. We'll have a
feast and a frolic. Let me check your parcels,
Mistress Anne."</p>

<p>Back they went to the golden-lighted streets and
turning down toward the city they reached at last
the big hotel which has usurped the place of the
stately and substantial edifices which were once the
abodes of ancient and honorable families.</p>

<p>Within were soft lights and the sound of music.
The rugs were thick, and there was much marble.
As they entered the dining-room, they seemed to
move through a golden haze. It was early, and most
of the tables were empty.</p>

<p>Beulah was rapturous. "I have always wanted to
come here. It is perfectly lovely."</p>

<p>The attentive waiter at Geoffrey's elbow was being
told to bring&mdash;&mdash; Anne's quick ear caught the
word.</p>

<p>"No, please," she said at once, "not for Beulah
and me."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>[<a href="./images/141.png">141</a>]</span>
His keen glance commanded her. "Of course
not," he said, easily. Presently he had the whole
matter of the menu settled, and could talk to Anne.
She was enjoying it all immensely and said so.</p>

<p>"I should like to do this sort of thing every day."</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid. You would lose your dreams,
and grow self-satisfied&mdash;and fat&mdash;like that woman
over there."</p>

<p>Anne shuddered. "It isn't that she is fat&mdash;it's
her eyes, and the way she makes up."</p>

<p>"That is the way they get when they live in
places like this. If you want to be slender and
lovely and keep your dreams you must teach
school."</p>

<p>"Oh, but there's drudgery in that."</p>

<p>"It is the people who drudge who dream. They
don't know it, but they do. People who have all
they want learn that there is nothing more for life to
give. And they drink and take drugs to bring back
the illusions they have lost."</p>

<p>They fell into silence after that, and then it was
Beulah who became voluble. Her fair round face
beamed. It was a common little face, but it was
good and honest. Beulah was having the time of
her life. She did not know that she owed her good
fortune to Anne, that if Anne had not been there,
Geoffrey would not have asked her to dine. But
if she had known it, she would not have cared.</p>

<p>"What train did you come in on?" she asked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>[<a href="./images/142.png">142</a>]</span>
"At noon. Brooks thought I ought to see a
specialist. He doesn't give me much encouragement
about my eyes. He wants me to stop writing,
but I shan't until I get through with my book."</p>

<p>He spoke recklessly, but Anne saw the shadow on
his face. "You aren't telling us how really serious it
is," she said, as Beulah's attention was diverted.</p>

<p>"It is so serious that for the first time in my life I
know myself to be&mdash;a coward. Last night I lay in
bed with my eyes shut to see how it would seem to
be blind. It was a pretty morbid thing to do&mdash;and
this morning finished me."</p>

<p>She tried to speak her sympathy, but could not.
Her eyes were full of tears.</p>

<p>"Don't," he said, softly, "my good little friend&mdash;my
good little friend."</p>

<p>She dabbed her eyes with her handkerchief. The
unconscious Beulah, busy with her oysters, asked:
"Is the Tobasco too hot? I'm all burning up with
it."</p>

<p>Geoffrey was able later to speak lightly of his
affliction. "I shall go to the Brooks ball as a Blind
Beggar."</p>

<p>"Oh, how can you make fun of it?"</p>

<p>"It is better to laugh than to cry. But your tears
were&mdash;a benediction."</p>

<p>Silence fell between them, and after a while he
asked, "What shall you wear?"</p>

<p>"To the ball? Pink silk. A heavenly pink. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>[<a href="./images/143.png">143</a>]</span>
have just bought it, and I paid more than I should
for it."</p>

<p>"Such extravagance!"</p>

<p>"I'm to be Cynthia Warfield&mdash;like the portrait in
the Crossroads library of my grandmother. It came
to me when I saw the silk in the shop window. I
shall have to do without the pearls, but I have the
lace flounces. They were left to my mother."</p>

<p>"And so Cinderella will go to the ball, and dance
with the Prince. Is Brooks the Prince?"</p>

<p>She flushed, and evaded. "I can't dance. Not
the new dances."</p>

<p>"I can teach you if you'll let me."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But you must pay. You must give the
Blind Beggar the first dance and as many more as
he demands."</p>

<p>"But I can't dance all of them with you."</p>

<p>"You can dance some of them. And that's my
price."</p>

<p>To promise him dances seemed to her quite delicious
and delightful since she could not dance at
all. But he made a little contract and had her sign
it, and put it in his pocket.</p>

<p>Going home Anne had little to say. It was Geoffrey
who talked, while Beulah slept in a seat by herself.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Anne made her own lovely gown, running over
now and then to take surreptitious peeps at Cynthia's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>[<a href="./images/144.png">144</a>]</span>
portrait. She had let Mrs. Brooks into her secret,
and the little lady was enthusiastic.</p>

<p>"You shall wear my pearls, my dear. They will
be very effective in your dark hair."</p>

<p>She brought the jewels down in an old blue velvet
box&mdash;milk-white against a yellowed satin lining.</p>

<p>"My father gave them to me on my wedding day.
Some day I shall give them to Richard's wife."</p>

<p>She could not know how her words stirred the
heart of the girl who stood looking so quietly down
at the pearls.</p>

<p>"I am almost afraid to wear them," Anne said
breathlessly. She gave Nancy a shy little kiss.
"You were <i>dear</i> to think of it."</p>

<p>And now busy days were upon her. There was
the school with Richard running in after closing time,
and staying, too, and keeping her from the work
that was waiting at home. Then at twilight a
dancing lesson with Geoffrey in the long front room,
with Beulah playing audience and sometimes Eric,
and with Peggy capering madly to the music.</p>

<p>Then the evening, with its enchanting task of
stitching on yards of rosy silk. Usually Geoffrey
read to her while she worked. His story was nearing
the end. He was wearing heavy goggles which
gave him an owl-like appearance, of which he complained.</p>

<p>"It spoils my beauty, Mistress Anne. I am just
an ugly gnome who sits at the feet of the Princess."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>[<a href="./images/145.png">145</a>]</span>
"You are not ugly, and you know it. And men
shouldn't be vain."</p>

<p>"We are worse than women. Do you know what
you look like with all that silk around you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Like Aurora. Do you remember that Stevenson
speaks of a 'pink dawn'? Well, you are a pink
dawn."</p>

<p>"Please stop talking about me, and read your last
chapter. I am so glad that you have reached the
end."</p>

<p>"Because you are tired of hearing it?"</p>

<p>"Because of your poor eyes."</p>

<p>He took off his goggles. "Do my eyes look different?
Are they changed or&mdash;dim?"</p>

<p>"They are as bright as stars," and he sighed with
relief.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"<i>And now it was young Michel who whispered,
'God is good! In a moment we shall see his face,
and we shall say to him, "We fought, but there
is no hatred in our hearts. We cannot hate&mdash;our
brothers&mdash;&mdash;"'</i>"</p>

<p>That was the end.</p>

<p>"It is a great book," Anne told him solemnly. "It
will be a great success."</p>

<p>He seemed to shrink and grow small in his chair.
"It will come&mdash;too late."</p>

<p>She looked up and saw the mood that was upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>[<a href="./images/146.png">146</a>]</span>
him. "Oh, you must not&mdash;not that," she said, hurriedly;
"if you give up now it will be a losing fight."</p>

<p>"Don't you suppose that I would fight if I felt
that I could win? But what can a man do with a
thing like this that is dragging him down to darkness?"</p>

<p>"You mustn't be discouraged. Dr. Brooks says
that it isn't&mdash;inevitable. You know that he said
that, and that the specialist said it."</p>

<p>"I know. But something tells me that I am facing&mdash;darkness."
He threw up his head. "Why
should we talk of it? Let me tell you rather how
much you have helped me with my book. If it had
not been for you I could not have written it."</p>

<p>"I am glad if I have been of service." Her words
sounded formal after the warmth of his own.</p>

<p>He laughed, with a touch of bitterness. "The
Princess serves," he said, "always and always
serves. She never grabs, as the rest of us do, at
happiness."</p>

<p>"I shall grab when it comes," she said, smiling a
little, "and I am happy now, because I am going to
wear my pretty gown."</p>

<p>"Which reminds me," he said, quickly, and
brought from his pocket a little box. "Your costume
won't be complete without these. I bought
them for you with the advance check which my
publishers sent after they had read the first chapters
of my book."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>[<a href="./images/147.png">147</a>]</span>
She opened the box. Within lay a little string of
pearls. Not such pearls as Nancy had shown her,
but milk-white none the less, with shining lovely
lights.</p>

<p>"Oh," she gave a distressed cry, "you shouldn't
have done it."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I can't accept them. Indeed I can't."</p>

<p>"I shall feel as if you had flung them in my face
if you give them back to me," heatedly.</p>

<p>"You shouldn't take it that way. It isn't fair to
take it that way."</p>

<p>"It isn't a question of fairness. It is a question of
kindness on your part."</p>

<p>"I want to be kind."</p>

<p>"Then take them."</p>

<p>She thought for a moment with her eyes on the
fire. When she raised them it was to say, "Would
you&mdash;want your little sister, Mimi, to take jewels
from any man?"</p>

<p>"Yes. If he loved her as I love you."</p>

<p>It was out, and they stood aghast. Then Geoffrey
stammered, "Can't you see that my soul kneels at
your feet? That to me these pearls aren't as white
as your&mdash;whiteness?"</p>

<p>The rosy silk had slipped to the floor. She was
like a very small goddess in a morning cloud. "I
can't take them. Oh, I can't."</p>

<p>He made a quick gesture. But for her restrain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>[<a href="./images/148.png">148</a>]</span>ing
hand he would have cast the pearls into the
flames.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't," she said, the little hand tense on his
arm. "Don't&mdash;hurt me&mdash;like that."</p>

<p>He dropped the pearls into his pocket. "If you
won't wear them nobody shall. I suppose I seem to
you like all sorts of a fool. I seem like all sorts of a
fool to myself."</p>

<p>He turned and left her.</p>

<p>An hour later he came back and found her still
sewing on the rosy silk. Her eyes were red, as if
she had wept a little.</p>

<p>"I was a brute," he said, repentantly; "forgive
me and smile. I am a tempestuous fellow, and I
forgot myself."</p>

<p>"I was afraid we weren't ever going to be friends
again."</p>

<p>"I shall always be your friend. Yet&mdash;who wants
a Blind Beggar for a friend&mdash;tell me that, Mistress
Anne?"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3><i>In Which a Blind Beggar and a Butterfly Go to a Ball.</i></h3>

<p class="right"><i>In my Own Little Room.</i>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uncle rod</span>, I went to the party!</p>

<p>I came home an hour ago, and since then I
have been sitting all shivery and shaky in my pink
silk. It will be daylight in a few minutes, but I
shan't go to bed. I couldn't sleep if I did. I feel
as if I shouldn't ever sleep again.</p>

<p>Uncle Rod, Jimmie Ford was at the Crossroads
ball!</p>

<p>I went early, because Mrs. Nancy had asked me to
be there to help with her guests. Geoffrey Fox
went with me. He was very picturesque in a
ragged jerkin with a black bandage over his eyes
and with old Mamie leading him at the end of a
cord. She enjoyed it immensely, and they attracted
a lot of attention, as he went tap-tapping along with
his cane over the polished floor, or whined for alms,
while she sat up on her haunches with a tin cup in
her mouth.</p>

<p>Well, Dr. Richard met us at the door, looking the
young squire to perfection in his grandfather's old
dress coat of blue with brass buttons. The people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>[<a href="./images/150.png">150</a>]</span>
from New York hadn't come, so Mrs. Nancy put the
pearls in my hair, and they made me stand under
the portrait in the library, to see if I were really like
my grandmother. I can't believe that I looked as
lovely as she, but they said I did, and I began to
feel as happy and excited as Cinderella at her ball.</p>

<p>Then the New York crowd arrived in motors, and
they were all masked. I knew Eve Chesley at
once and Winifred Ames, but it was hard to be sure
of any one else. Eve Chesley was a Rose, with a
thousand fluttering flounces of pink chiffon. She
was pursued by two men dressed as Butterflies, slim
and shining in close caps with great silken wings&mdash;a
Blue Butterfly and a Brown one. I was pretty
sure that the Brown one was Philip Meade. It was
quite wonderful to watch them with their wings
waving. Eve carried a pocketful of rose petals and
threw them into the air as she went. I had never
imagined anything so lovely.</p>

<p>Well, I danced with Dr. Richard and I danced
with Geoffrey Fox, and I danced with Dutton Ames,
and with some men that I had never met before. It
seemed so <i>good</i> to be doing things like the rest.
Then all at once I began to feel that the Blue
Butterfly was watching me. He drifted away from
his pursuit of Evelyn Chesley, and whenever I raised
my eyes, I could see him in corners staring at me.</p>

<p>It gave me a queer feeling. I couldn't be sure,
and yet&mdash;there he was. And, Uncle Rod, suddenly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>[<a href="./images/151.png">151</a>]</span>
I knew him! Something in the way he carried himself.
You know Jimmie's little swagger!</p>

<p>I think I lost my head after that. I flirted with
Dr. Richard and with Geoffrey Fox. I think I even
flirted a little with Dutton Ames. I wanted them to
be nice to me. I wanted Jimmie to see that what he
had scorned other men could value. I wanted him
to know that I had forgotten him. I laughed and
danced as if my heart was as light as my heels, and
all the while I was just sick and faint with the
thought of it&mdash;"Jimmie Ford is here, and he hasn't
said a word to me. Jimmie Ford is here&mdash;and&mdash;he
hasn't said a word&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At last I couldn't stand it any longer, and when I
was dancing with Geoffrey Fox I said, "Do you
think we could go down to the Garden Room? I
must get away."</p>

<p>He didn't ask any question. And presently we
were down there in the quiet, and he had his bandage
off, and was looking at me, anxiously. "What
has happened, Mistress Anne?"</p>

<p>And then, oh, Uncle Rod, I told him. I don't
know how I came to do it, but it seemed to me that
he would understand, and he did.</p>

<p>When I had finished his face was white and set.
"Do you mean to tell me that any man has tried to
break your heart?"</p>

<p>I think I was crying a little. "Yes. But the
worst of all is my&mdash;pride."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>[<a href="./images/152.png">152</a>]</span>
"My little Princess," he said softly, "that this
should have come&mdash;to you."</p>

<p>Uncle Rod, I think that if I had ever had a
brother, I should have wanted him to be like Geoffrey
Fox. All his lightness and frivolity seemed to
slip from him. "He has thrown away what I would
give my life for," he said. "Oh, the young fool, not
to know that Paradise was being handed to him on
a platter."</p>

<p>I didn't tell him Jimmie's name. That is not to
be spoken to any one but you. And of course he
could not know, though perhaps he guessed it, after
what happened later.</p>

<p>While we sat there, Dr. Richard came to hunt for
us. "Everybody is going in to supper," he said.
He seemed surprised to find us there together, and
there was a sort of stiffness in his manner. "Mother
has been asking for you."</p>

<p>We went at once to the dining-room. There
were long tables set in the old-fashioned way for
everybody. Mrs. Nancy wanted things to be as
they had been in her own girlhood. On the table in
the wide window were two birthday cakes, and at
that table Dr. Richard sat with his mother on one
side of him, and Eve Chesley on the other. Eve's
cake had pink candles and his had white, and there
were twenty-five candles on each cake.</p>

<p>Geoffrey Fox and I sat directly opposite; Dutton
Ames was on my right, Mrs. Ames was on Geoffrey's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>[<a href="./images/153.png">153</a>]</span>
left, and straight across the table, with his mask off,
was Jimmie Ford, staring at me with all his eyes!</p>

<p>For a minute I didn't know what to do. I just sat
and stared, and then suddenly I picked up the glass
that stood by my plate, raised it in salute and drank
smiling. His face cleared, he hesitated just a fraction
of a second, then his glass went up, and he returned
my greeting. I wonder if he thought that I would
cut him dead, Uncle Rod?</p>

<p>And don't worry about <i>what</i> I drank. It was
white grape juice. Mrs. Nancy won't have anything
stronger.</p>

<p>Well, after that I ate, and didn't know what I
ate, for everything seemed as dry as dust. I know
my cheeks were red and that my eyes shone, and I
smiled until my face ached. And all the while I
watched Jimmie and Jimmie watched me, and
pretty soon, Uncle Rod, I understood why Jimmie
was there.</p>

<p>He was making love to Eve Chesley!</p>

<p>Making love is very different from being in love,
isn't it? Perhaps love is something that Jimmie
really doesn't understand. But he was using on
Eve all of the charming tricks that he had tried
on me. She is more sophisticated, and they mean
less to her than to me, but I could see him bending
toward her in that flattering worshipful way of his&mdash;and
when he took one of her roses and touched
it to his lips and then to her cheek, everything was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>[<a href="./images/154.png">154</a>]</span>
dark for a minute. That kind of kiss was the only
kind that Jimmie Ford ever gave me, but to me it
had meant that he&mdash;cared&mdash;and that I cared&mdash;and
here he was doing it before the eyes of all the world&mdash;and
for love of another woman!</p>

<p>After supper he came around the table and spoke
to me. I suppose he thought he had to. I don't
know what he said and I don't care. I only know
that I wanted to get away. I think it was then that
Geoffrey Fox guessed. For when Jimmie had gone
he said, very gently, "Would you like to go home?
You look like your own little ghost, Mistress Anne."</p>

<p>But I had promised one more dance to Dr. Richard,
and I wanted to dance it. If you could have
seen at the table how he towered above Jimmie
Ford. And when he stood up to make a little
speech in response to a toast from Dutton Ames,
his voice rang out in such a&mdash;man's way. Do you
remember Jimmie Ford's falsetto?</p>

<p>I had my dance with him, and then Geoffrey took
me home, and all the way I kept remembering the
things Dr. Richard had said to me, such pleasant
friendly things, and when his mother told me "good-night"
she took my face between her hands and
kissed me. "You must come often, little Cynthia
Warfield," she said. "Richard and I both want
you."</p>

<p>But now that I am at home again, I can't think
of anything but how Jimmie Ford has spoiled it all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>[<a href="./images/155.png">155</a>]</span>
When you have given something, you can't ever
really take it back, can you? When you've given
faith and constancy to one man, what have you left
to give another?</p>

<p>The river is beginning to show like a silver
streak, and a rooster is crowing. Oh, Uncle Rod,
if you were only here. Write and tell me that you
love me.</p>

<p class="right"><i>In the Telegraph Tower.</i>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My very Dear:</span></p>

<p>It is after supper, and Beulah and I are out
here with Eric. He likes to have her come, and
I play propriety, for Mrs. Bower, in common with
most women of her class, is very careful of her
daughter. I know you don't like that word "class,"
but please don't think I am using it snobbishly.
Indeed, I think Beulah is much better brought up
than the daughters of folk who think themselves
much finer, and Mrs. Bower in her simple way is
doing some very effective chaperoning.</p>

<p>Eric is on night duty in the telegraph tower this
week; the other operator has the day work. The
evenings are long, so Beulah brings her sewing,
and keeps Eric company. They really don't have
much to say to each other, so that I am not interrupted
when I write. They seem to like to sit and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>[<a href="./images/156.png">156</a>]</span>
look out on the river and the stars and the moon
coming up behind the hills.</p>

<p>It is all settled now. Eric told me yesterday.
"I am very happy," he said; "I have been a lonely
man."</p>

<p>They are to be married in June, and the things
that she is making are to go into the cedar
chest which her father has given her. He found it
one day when he was in Baltimore, and when he
showed it to her, he shone with pleasure. He's
a good old Peter, and he is so glad that Beulah
is to marry Eric. Eric will rent a little house not
far up the road. It is a dear of a cottage, and Peggy
and I call it the Playhouse. We sit on the porch when
we come home from school, and peep in at the windows
and plan what we would put into it if we had
the furnishing of it. I should like a house like that,
Uncle Rod, for you and me and Diogenes. We'd
live happy ever after, wouldn't we? Some day the
world is going to build "teacherages" just as it now
builds parsonages, and the little houses will help to
dignify and uplift the profession.</p>

<p>Your dear letter came just in time, and it was just
right. I should have gone to pieces if you had
pitied me, for I was pitying myself dreadfully. But
when I read "Little School-teacher, what would you
tell your scholars?" I knew what you wanted me to
answer. I carried your letter in my pocket to school,
and when I rang the bell I kept saying over and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>[<a href="./images/157.png">157</a>]</span>
over to myself, "Life is what we make it. Life is
what we make it," and all at once the bells began
to ring it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Life is&mdash;what we&mdash;make it&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">Life is&mdash;what we&mdash;make it."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When the children came in, before we began the
day's work, I talked to them. I find it is always uplifting
when we have failed in anything to try to tell
others how not to fail! Perhaps it isn't preaching
what we practice, but at least it supplies a working
theory.</p>

<p>I made up a fairy-story for them, too, about a
Princess who was so ill and unhappy that all the
kingdom was searched far and wide for some one to
cure her. And at last an old crone was found who
swore that she had the right remedy. "What is
it?" all the wise men asked; but the old woman
said, "It is written in this scroll. To-morrow the
Princess must start out alone upon a journey. Whatever
difficulty she encounters she must open this
scroll and read, and the scroll will tell her what to
do."</p>

<p>Well, the Princess started out, and when she had
traveled a little way she found that she was hungry
and tired, and she cried: "Oh, I haven't anything
to eat." Then the scroll said, "Read me," and she
opened the scroll and read: "There is corn in the
fields. You must shell it and grind it on a stone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>[<a href="./images/158.png">158</a>]</span>
and mix it with water, and bake it into the best
bread that you can." So the Princess shelled the
corn and ground it and mixed it with water, and
baked it, and it tasted as sweet as honey and as
crisp as apples. And the Princess ate with an appetite,
and then she lay down to rest. And in the
night a storm came up and there was no shelter, and
the Princess cried out, "Oh, what shall I do?" and
the scroll said, "Read me." So she opened the
scroll and read: "There is wood on the ground.
You must gather it and stack it and build the best
little house that you can." So the Princess worked
all that day and the next and the next, and when
the hut was finished it was strong and dry and no
storms could destroy it. So the Princess stayed
there in the little hut that she had made, and ate the
sweet loaves that she had baked, and one day a
great black bear came down the road, and the Princess
cried out, "Oh, I have no weapon; what shall
I do?" And the scroll said, "Read me." So she
opened the scroll and read, "Walk straight up to
the bear, and make the best fight that you can."
So the Princess, trembling, walked straight up to
the big black bear, and behold! when he saw her
coming, he ran away!</p>

<p>Now the year was up, and the king sent his wise
men to bring the Princess home, and one day they
came to her little hut and carried her back to the
palace, and she was so rosy and well that everybody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>[<a href="./images/159.png">159</a>]</span>
wondered. Then the king called the people together,
and said, "Oh, Princess, speak to us, and
let us know how you were cured." So the Princess
told them of how she had baked the bread, and built
the hut, and conquered the bear; and of how she had
found health and happiness. For the bread that you
make with your own hands is the sweetest, and the
shelter that you build for yourself is the snuggest,
and the fear that you face is no fear at all.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The children liked my story, and I felt very brave
when I had finished it. You see, I have been forgetting
our sunsets, and I have been shivery and
shaky when I should have faced my Big Black
Bear!</p>

<p>Beulah is ready to go&mdash;and so&mdash;good-night. The
moon is high up and round, and as pure gold as
your own loving heart.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3><i>In Which Brinsley Speaks of the Way to Win a
Woman.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">And</span> now spring was coming to the countryside.
The snow melted, and the soft rains fell, and
on sunny days Diogenes, splashing in the little
puddles, picked and pulled at his feathers as he
preened himself in the shelter of the south bank
which overlooked the river.</p>

<p>Some of the feathers were tipped with shining
green and some with brown. Some of them fell by
the way, some floated out on blue tides, and one of
them was wafted by the wind to the feet of Geoffrey
Fox, as, on a certain morning, he, too, stood on the
south bank.</p>

<p>He picked it up and stuck it in his hat. "I'll
wear it for my lady," he said to the old drake, "and
much good may it do me!"</p>

<p>The old drake lifted his head toward the sky, and
gave a long cry. But it was not for Anne that he
called. She still gave him food and drink. He still
met her at the gate. If her mind was less upon him
than in the past, it mattered little. The things that
held meaning for him this morning were the glory
of the sunshine, and the softness of the breeze.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>[<a href="./images/161.png">161</a>]</span>
Stirring within him was a need above and beyond
anything that Geoffrey could give, or Anne. He
listened not for the step of the little school-teacher,
but for the whirring wings of some comrade of his
own kind. Again and again he sent forth his cry to
the empty air.</p>

<p>Geoffrey's heart echoed the cry. His book was
finished, and it was time for him to go. Yet he was
held by a tie stronger than any which had hitherto
bound him. Here in the big old house at Bower's
was the one thing that his heart wanted.</p>

<p>"I could make her happy," he whispered to that
inner self which warned him. "With her as my
wife and with my book a success, I could defy fate."</p>

<p>The day was Saturday, and all the eager old
fishermen had arrived the night before. Brinsley
Tyson coming out with his rod in his hand and a
broad-brimmed hat on his head invited Geoffrey to
join him. "I've a motor boat that will take us out
to the island after we have done a morning's fishing,
and Mrs. Bower has put up a lunch."</p>

<p>"The glare is bad for my eyes."</p>

<p>"Been working them too hard?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"There's an awning and smoked glasses if you'll
wear them. And I don't want to go alone. David
went back on me; he's got a new book. It's a
puzzle to me why any man should want to read
when he can have a day's fishing."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>[<a href="./images/162.png">162</a>]</span>
"If people didn't read what would become of my
books?"</p>

<p>"Let 'em read. But not on days like this."
Brinsley's fat face was upturned to the sun. With
a vine-wreath instead of his broad hat and tunic in
place of his khaki he might have posed for any of
the plump old gods who loved the good things of
life.</p>

<p>Geoffrey, because he had nothing else to do, went
with him. Anne was invisible. On Saturday mornings
she did all of the things she had left undone
during the week. She mended and sewed and
washed her brushes, and washed her hair, and gave
all of her little belongings a special rub and scrub,
and showed herself altogether exquisite and housewifely.</p>

<p>She saw Geoffrey start out, and she waved to him.
He waved back, his hand shading his eyes. When
he had gone, she cleaned all of her toilet silver, and
ran ribbons into nicely embroidered nainsook things,
and put her pillows in the sun and tied up her head
and swept and dusted, and when she had made
everything shining, she had a bit of lunch on a tray,
and then she washed her hair.</p>

<p>Geoffrey ate lunch on the island with Brinsley
Tyson. He liked the old man immensely. There
was a flavor about his worldliness which had nothing
to do with stale frivolities; it was rather a thing of
fastidious taste and of tempered wit. He was keen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>[<a href="./images/163.png">163</a>]</span>
in his judgments of men, and charitable in his estimates
of women.</p>

<p>Brinsley Tyson had known Baltimore before the
days of modern cities. He had known it before it
had cut its hotels after the palace pattern, and when
Rennert's in more primitive quarters had been the
Mecca for epicureans. He had known its theaters
when the footlight favorites were Lotta and Jo
Emmet, and when the incomparable Booth and
Jefferson had held audiences spellbound at Ford's
and at Albaugh's. He had known Charles Street
before it was extended, and he had known its Sunday
parade. He had known the Bay Line Boats,
the harbor and the noisy streets that led to the
wharves. He had known Lexington Market on
Saturday afternoons; the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
in the heyday of its importance, and more than
all he had known the beauties and belles of old
Baltimore, and it added piquancy to many of his
anecdotes when he spoke of his single estate as a
tragedy resulting from his devotion to too many
charmers, with no possibility of making a choice.</p>

<p>It was of these things that he spoke while Geoffrey,
lying in the grass with his arm across his eyes,
listened and enjoyed.</p>

<p>"And you never married, sir?"</p>

<p>"I've told you there were too many of them. If I
could have had any one of those girls on this island
with 'tother dear charmers away, there wouldn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>[<a href="./images/164.png">164</a>]</span>
have been any trouble. But a choice with them all
about me was&mdash;impossible." His old eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>"Suppose you had made a choice, and she hadn't
cared for you?" said the voice of the man on the
grass.</p>

<p>"Any woman will care if you go at it the right
way."</p>

<p>"What is the right way?"</p>

<p>"There's only one way to win a woman. If she
says she won't marry you, carry her off by force to a
clergyman, and when you get her there make her
say 'Yes.'"</p>

<p>Geoffrey sat up. "You don't mean that literally?"</p>

<p>Brinsley nodded. "Indeed I do. Take the attitude
with them of Man the Conqueror. They all
like it. Man the Suppliant never gets what he
wants."</p>

<p>"But in these days primitive methods aren't
possible."</p>

<p>Brinsley skipped a chicken bone expertly across
the surface of the water. "Primitive methods are
always possible. The trouble is that man has lost
his nerve. The cult of chivalry has spoiled him.
It has taught him to kneel at his lady's feet, where
pre-historically he kept his foot on her neck!"</p>

<p>Geoffrey laughed. "You'd be mobbed in a suffrage
meeting."</p>

<p>"Suffrage, my dear fellow, is the green carnation
in the garden of femininity. Every woman blooms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>[<a href="./images/165.png">165</a>]</span>
for her lover. It is the lack of lovers that produces
the artificial&mdash;hence votes for women. What does
the woman being carried off under the arm of conquering
man care for yellow banners or speeches
from the tops of busses? She is too busy trying to
please him."</p>

<p>"It would be a great experiment. I'd like to try
it."</p>

<p>Brinsley, uncorking a hot and cold bottle, boldly
surmised, "It is the little school-teacher?"</p>

<p>Geoffrey, again flat on the grass, murmured,
"Yes."</p>

<p>"And it is neck and neck between you and that
young cousin of mine?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid he is a neck ahead."</p>

<p>"It all depends upon which runs away with her
first."</p>

<p>Again Geoffrey murmured, "I'd like to try it."</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Brinsley and beamed over his
coffee cup like a benevolent spider at an unsuspecting
fly. He had no idea that his fooling might be taken
seriously. It was not given to his cynicism to comprehend
the mood of the seemingly composed young
person who lay on the grass with his hat over his
eyes&mdash;torn by contending emotions, maddened by
despair and the dread of darkness, awakened to new
impulses in which youth and hot blood fought
against an almost reverent tenderness for the object
of his adoration. Since the night of the Crossroads<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>[<a href="./images/166.png">166</a>]</span>
ball Geoffrey had permitted himself to hope. She
had turned to him then. For the first time he had
felt that the barriers were down between them.</p>

<p>"Now Richard," Brinsley was saying, as he
smoked luxuriously after the feast, "ought to marry
Eve. She'll get her Aunt Maude's money, and be
the making of him."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Richard, who at that very moment was riding
through the country on his old white horse, had no
thought of Eve.</p>

<p>The rhythm of old Ben's even trot formed an
accompaniment to the song that his heart was
singing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I think she was the most beautiful lady,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">That ever was in the West Country&mdash;&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As he passed along the road, he was aware of the
world's awakening. His ears caught the faint flat
bleating of lambs, the call of the cocks, the high
note of the hens, the squeal of little pigs, and above
all, the clamor of blackbirds and of marauding crows.</p>

<p>The trees, too, were beginning to show the pale
tints of spring, and an amethyst haze enveloped the
hills. The river was silver in the shadow and gold
in the sun; the little streams that ran down to it
seemed to sing as they went.</p>

<p>Coming at last to an old white farmhouse, Richard
dismounted and went in. The old man bent with
rheumatism welcomed him, and the old wife said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>[<a href="./images/167.png">167</a>]</span>
"He is always better when he knows that you are
coming, doctor."</p>

<p>The old man nodded. "Your gran'dad used to
come. I was a little boy an' croupy, and he seemed
big as a house when he came in at the door. He
was taller than you, and thin."</p>

<p>"Now, father," the old woman protested, "the
young doctor ain't fat."</p>

<p>"He's fatter'n his gran'dad. But I ain't saying
that I don't like it. I like meat on a man's bones."</p>

<p>Richard laughed. "Just so that I don't go the way
of Cousin Brin. You know Brinsley Tyson, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"He's the fat twin. Yes, I know him and David.
David comes and reads to me, but Brinsley went to
Baltimore, and now he don't seem to remember that
we were boys together, and went to the Crossroads
school."</p>

<p>After that they spoke of the little new teacher, and
Richard revelled in the praise they gave her. She
was worshipped, they said, by the people roundabout.
There had never been another like her.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>I think she was the most beautiful lady,</i><br /></span>
<span class="ihalf"><i>That ever was in the West Country</i>&mdash;&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>was Richard's enlargement of their theme. In the
weeks just past he had seen much of her, and it had
seemed to him that life began and ended with his
thought of her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>[<a href="./images/168.png">168</a>]</span>
When he rose to go the old woman went to the
door with him. "I guess we owe you a lot by this
time," she remarked; "you've made so many calls.
It cheers him up to have you, but you'd better stop
now that he don't need you. It's so far, and we
ain't good pay like some of them."</p>

<p>Richard squared his shoulders&mdash;a characteristic
gesture. "Don't bother about the bill. I have a sort
of sentiment about my grandfather's old patients.
It is a pleasure to know them and serve them."</p>

<p>"If you didn't mind taking your pay in chickens,"
she stated as he mounted his horse, "we could let
you have some broilers."</p>

<p>"You will need all you can raise." Then as his
eyes swept the green hill which sloped down to the
river, he perceived an orderly line of waddling fowls
making their way toward the house.</p>

<p>"I'd like a white duck," he said, "if you could let
me take her now."</p>

<p>He chose a meek and gentle creature who submitted
to the separation from the rest of her kind
without rebellion. Tucked under Richard's arm,
she surveyed the world with some alarm, but presently,
as he rode on with her, she seemed to acquiesce
in her abduction and faced the adventure with
serene eyes, murmuring now and then some note of
demure interrogation as she nestled quite confidently
against the big man who rode so easily his great
white horse.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>[<a href="./images/169.png">169</a>]</span>
And thus they came to Bower's, to find Anne on
the south bank, like a very modern siren, drying her
hair, with Diogenes nipping the new young grass
near her.</p>

<p>She saw them coming. Richard wore a short
rough coat and an old alpine hat of green. His
leggings were splashed with mud, and the white horse
was splashed, but there was about the pair of them
an air of gallant achievement.</p>

<p>She rose to greet them. She was blushing a little
and with her dark hair blowing she was "the most
beautiful," like the lady in the song.</p>

<p>"I thought no one would be coming," was her
apology, "and out here I get the wind and sun."</p>

<p>"All the old fishermen will be wrecked on the
rocks if they get a glimpse of you," he told her
gravely; "you mustn't turn their poor old heads."</p>

<p>And now the white duck murmured.</p>

<p>"The lovely dear, where did you get her?" Anne
asked.</p>

<p>"In the hills, to cheer up Diogenes."</p>

<p>He set the white duck down. She shook her
feathers and again spoke interrogatively. And now
Diogenes lifted his head and answered. For a few
moments he rent the air with his song of triumph.
Then he turned and led the way to the river. There
was a quiet pool in the bend of the bank. The old
drake breasted its shining waters, and presently the
white duck followed. With a sort of restrained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>[<a href="./images/170.png">170</a>]</span>
coquetry she turned her head from side to side. All
her questions were answered, all her murmurs
stilled.</p>

<p>Richard and Anne smiled at each other. "What
made you think of it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I thought you'd like it."</p>

<p>"I do." She began to twist up her hair.</p>

<p>"Please don't. I like to see it down."</p>

<p>"But people will be coming in."</p>

<p>"Why should we be here when they come? I'll
put Ben in the stable&mdash;and we'll go for a walk. Do
you know there are violets in the wood?"</p>

<p>From under the red-striped awning of Brinsley's
boat Geoffrey Fox saw Anne's hair blowing like a
sable banner in the breeze. He saw Richard's
square figure peaked up to the alpine hat. He saw
them enter the wood.</p>

<p>He shut his eyes from the glare of the sun and
lay quietly on the cushions of the little launch. But
though his eyes were shut, he could still see those
two figures walking together in the dreamy dimness
of the spring forest.</p>

<p>"What were the ethics of the primitive man?"
he asked Brinsley suddenly. "Did he run away
with a woman who belonged to somebody else?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" Brinsley's reel was whirring. "And
now if you don't mind, Fox, you might be ready
with the net. If this fish is as big as he pulls, he
will weigh a ton."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>[<a href="./images/171.png">171</a>]</span>
Geoffrey, coming in, found Peggy disconsolate on
the pier.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I can't find Anne. She said that after her hair
dried she'd go for a walk to Beulah's playhouse, and
we were to have tea. Beulah was to bring it."</p>

<p>"She has gone for a walk with some one else."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Dr. Brooks. Let's go and look for her, Peggy,
and when we find her we will tell her what we think
of her for running away."</p>

<p>The green stillness of the grove was very grateful
after the glare of the river. Geoffrey walked quickly,
with the child's hand in his. He had a feeling that
if he did not walk quickly he would be too late.</p>

<p>He was not too late; he saw that at a glance.
Richard had dallied in his wooing. It had been so
wonderful to be with her. Once when he had knelt
beside her to pick violets, the wind had blown across
his face a soft sweet strand of her hair. It was then
that she had braided it, sitting on a fallen log under
a blossoming dogwood.</p>

<p>"It is so long," she had said with a touch of
pride, "that it is a great trouble to care for it.
Cynthia Warfield had hair like mine."</p>

<p>"I don't believe that any one ever had hair like
yours. It seems to me as if every strand must have
been made specially in some celestial shop, and then
the pattern destroyed."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>[<a href="./images/172.png">172</a>]</span>
How lovely she was when she blushed like that!
How little and lovely and wise and good. He liked
little women. His mother was small, and he was
glad that both she and Anne had delicate hands and
feet. He was aware that this preference was old-fashioned,
but it was, none the less, the way he felt
about it.</p>

<p>And now there broke upon the silence of the
wood the sound of murmuring voices. Peggy and
Geoffrey Fox had invaded their Paradise!</p>

<p>"We thought," Peggy complained, "that we had
lost you. Anne, you promised about the tea."</p>

<p>"Oh, Peggy, I forgot."</p>

<p>"Beulah's gone with the basket and Eric, and we
can't be late because there are hot biscuits."</p>

<p>Hurrying toward the biscuits and their hotness,
Anne ran ahead with Peggy.</p>

<p>"How about the eyes?" Richard asked as he and
Geoffrey followed.</p>

<p>"I've been on the water, and it is bad for them.
But I'm not going to worry. I am getting out of
life more than I hoped&mdash;more than I dared hope."</p>

<p>His voice had a high note of excitement. Richard
glanced at him. For a moment he wondered if Fox
had been drinking.</p>

<p>But Geoffrey was intoxicated with the wine of his
dreams. With a quick gesture in which he seemed
to throw from him all the fears which had oppressed
him, he told his triumphant lie.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>[<a href="./images/173.png">173</a>]</span>
"I am going to marry Anne Warfield; she has
promised to be eyes for me, and light&mdash;the sun and
the moon."</p>

<p>Richard's face grew gray. He spoke with difficulty.
"She has promised?"</p>

<p>Then again Geoffrey lied, meaning indeed before
the night had passed to make his words come true.
"She is going to marry me&mdash;and I am the happiest
man alive!"</p>

<p>The light went out of Richard's world. How
blind he had been. He had taken her smiles and
blushes to himself when she had glowed with a
happiness which had nothing to do with him.</p>

<p>He steadied himself to speak. "You are a lucky
fellow, Fox; you must let me congratulate you."</p>

<p>"The world doesn't know," Geoffrey said, "not
yet. But I had to tell it to some one, and a doctor
is a sort of secular father confessor."</p>

<p>Richard's laugh was without mirth. "If you
mean that it's not to be told, you may rely on my
discretion."</p>

<p>"Of course. I told you she was to play Beatrice
to my Dante, but she shall be more than that."</p>

<p>It was a rather silent party which had tea on the
porch of the Playhouse. But Beulah and Eric were
not aware of any lack in their guests. Eric had
been to Baltimore the day before, and Beulah wore
her new ring. She accepted Richard's congratulations
shyly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>[<a href="./images/174.png">174</a>]</span>
"I like my little new house," she said; "have
you been over it?"</p>

<p>He said that he had not, and she took him. Eric
went with them, and as they stood in the door of an
upper room, he put his arm quite frankly about
Beulah's shoulders as she explained their plans to
Richard. "This is to be in pink and the other one
in white, and all the furniture is to be pink and
white."</p>

<p>She was as pink and white and pretty as the
rooms she was planning, and to see her standing
there within the circle of her lover's arm was heart-warming.</p>

<p>"You must get some roses from my mother,
Beulah, for your little garden," the young doctor
told her; "all pink and white like the rest of it."</p>

<p>He let them go down ahead of him, and so it
happened that he stood for a moment alone in a
little upper porch at the back of the house which
overlooked the wood. The shadows were gathering
in its dim aisles, shutting out the daylight, shutting
out the dreams which he had lost that day in the
fragrant depths.</p>

<p>When later he came with the rest of them to
Bower's, the river was stained with the sunset.
Diogenes and the white duck breasted serenely the
crimson surface. Certain old fishermen trailed belatedly
up the bank. Others sat spick and span
and ready for supper on the porch.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>[<a href="./images/175.png">175</a>]</span>
Brinsley Tyson over the top of his newspaper
hailed Richard.</p>

<p>"There's a telephone call for you. They've been
trying to get you for an hour."</p>

<p>He went in at once, and coming out told Anne
good-night. "Thank you for a happy afternoon,"
he said.</p>

<p>But she missed something in his voice, something
that had been there when they had walked in the
wood.</p>

<p>She watched him as he went away, square-shouldered
and strong on his big white horse. She had
a troubled sense that things had in some fateful and
tragic way gone wrong with her afternoon, but it
was not yet given to her to know that young Richard
on his big white horse was riding out of her life.</p>

<p>It was after supper that Geoffrey asked her to go
out on the river with him.</p>

<p>"Not to-night. I'm tired."</p>

<p>"Just a little minute, Mistress Anne. To see the
moon come up over the island. Please." So she
consented.</p>

<p>Helping her into the boat, Geoffrey's hands were
shaking. The boat swept out from the pier in a
wide curve, and he drew a long breath. He had her
now&mdash;it would be a great adventure&mdash;like a book&mdash;better
than any book.</p>

<p>Primitive man in prehistoric days carried his
woman off captive under his arm. Geoffrey, pursu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>[<a href="./images/176.png">176</a>]</span>ing
modern methods, had borrowed Brinsley's boat.
A rug was folded innocently on the cushions; in a
snug little cupboard under the stern seat were certain
supplies&mdash;a great adventure, surely!</p>

<p>And now the boat was under the bridge; the signal
lights showed red and green. Then as they slipped
around the first island there was only the silver of
the moonshine spread out over the waters.</p>

<p>Geoffrey stopped the motor. "We'll drift and
talk."</p>

<p>"You talk," she told him, "and I'll listen, and we
mustn't be too late."</p>

<p>"What is too late?"</p>

<p>"I told you I would stay just a little minute."</p>

<p>"There is no real reason why we shouldn't stay as
long as we wish. You are surely not so prim that
you are doing it for propriety."</p>

<p>"You know I am not prim."</p>

<p>"Yes you are. You are prim and Puritan and
sometimes you are a prig. But I like you that way,
Mistress Anne. Only to-night I shall do as I please."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly."</p>

<p>"Is it silly to love you&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>He argued it with her brilliantly&mdash;so that it was
only when the red and green lights of a second bridge
showed ahead of them that she said, sharply, "We
are miles away from Bower's; we must go back."</p>

<p>"It won't take us long," he said, easily, and presently
they were purring up-stream.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>[<a href="./images/177.png">177</a>]</span>
Then all at once the motor stopped. Geoffrey,
inspecting it with a flashlight, said, succinctly,
"Engine's on the blink."</p>

<p>"You mean that we can't go on?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll tinker it up. Only you'll have to let me
get into that box under the stern seat for the tools.
You can hold the light while I work."</p>

<p>As he worked they drifted. They passed the
second bridge. Anne, steering, grew cold and
shivered. But she did not complain. She was
glad, however, when Geoffrey said, "You'd better
curl down among the cushions, and let me wrap you
in this rug."</p>

<p>"Can you manage without me?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I've patched it up partially. And you'll
freeze in this bitter air."</p>

<p>The wind had changed and there was now no
moon. She was glad of the warmth of the rug and
the comfort of the cushioned space. She shut her
eyes, after a time, and, worn out by the emotions of
the day, she dropped into fitful slumber.</p>

<p>Then Geoffrey, his hair blown back by the wind,
stood at the wheel and steered his boat not up-stream
toward the bridge at Bower's, but straight down
toward the wider waters, where the river stretches
out into the Bay.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3><i>In Which Eve Usurps an Ancient Masculine Privilege.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Aunt maude chesley</span> belonged to the
various patriotic societies which are dependent
on Revolutionary fighting blood, on Dutch forbears,
or on the ancestral holding of Colonial office. The
last stood highest in her esteem. It was the hardest
to get into, hence there was about it the sanctity of
exclusiveness. Any man might spill his blood for
his country, and among those early Hollanders were
many whose blood was red instead of blue, but it
was only a choice few who in the early days of the
country's history had been appointed by the Crown
or elected by the people to positions of influence and
of authority.</p>

<p>When Aunt Maude went to the meeting of her
favorite organization, she wore always black velvet
which showed the rounds of her shoulders, point lace
in a deep bertha, the family diamonds, and all of her
badges. The badges had bars and jewels, and the
effect was imposing.</p>

<p>Evelyn laughed at her. "Nobody cares for ancestors
any more. Not since people began to hunt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>[<a href="./images/179.png">179</a>]</span>
them up. You can find anything if you look for it,
Aunt Maude. And most of the crests are bought or
borrowed so that if one really belongs to you, you
don't like to speak of it, any more than to tell that
you are a lady or take a daily bath."</p>

<p>"Our ancestors," said Aunt Maude solemnly, "are
our heritage from the past&mdash;but you have reverence
for nothing."</p>

<p>"They were a jolly old lot," Eve agreed, "and I
am proud of them. But some of their descendants
are a scream. If men had their minds on being ancestors
instead of bragging of them there'd be some
hope for the future of old families."</p>

<p>Aunt Maude, having been swathed by her maid
in a silk scarf, so that her head was stiff with it,
batted her eyes. "If you would go with me," she
said, "and hear some of the speeches, you might look
at it differently. Now there was a Van Tromp&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And in New England there were Codcapers, and
in Virginia there were Pantops. I take off my hat
to them, but not to their descendants, indiscriminately."</p>

<p>And now Aunt Maude, more than ever mummified
in a gold and black brocade wrap trimmed with
black fur, steered her uncertain way toward the
motor at the door.</p>

<p>"People in my time&mdash;&mdash;" floated over her shoulder
and then as the door closed behind her, her eloquence
was lost.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>[<a href="./images/180.png">180</a>]</span>
Eve, alone, faced a radiant prospect. Richard
was coming. He had telephoned. She had not
told Aunt Maude. She wanted him to herself.</p>

<p>When at last he arrived she positively crowed
over him. "Oh, Dicky, this is darling of you."</p>

<p>A shadow fell across her face, however, when he
told her why he had come.</p>

<p>"Austin wanted me with him in an operation.
He telegraphed me and I took the first train. I
have been here for two days without a minute's
time in which to call you up."</p>

<p>"I thought that perhaps you had come to see me."</p>

<p>"Seeing you is a pleasant part of it, Eve."</p>

<p>He was really glad to see her; to be drawn away
by it all from the somberness of his thoughts. The
night before he had left the train on the Jersey side
and had ferried over so that he might view once
more the sky-line of the great city. There had been
a stiff breeze blowing and it had seemed to him that
he drew the first full breath since the moment when
he had walked with Geoffrey in the wood. What
had followed had been like a dream; the knowledge
that the great surgeon wanted him, his mother's
quick service in helping him pack his bag, the walk
to Bower's in the fragrant dark to catch the ten
o'clock train; the moment on the porch at Bower's
when he had learned from a word dropped by
Beulah that Anne was on the river with Geoffrey.</p>

<p>And now it all seemed so far away&mdash;the river with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>[<a href="./images/181.png">181</a>]</span>
the moon's broad path, Bower's low house and its
yellow-lighted panes, the silence, the darkness.</p>

<p>Since morning he had done a thousand things.
He had been to the hospital and had yielded once
more to the spell of its splendid machinery; he had
talked with Austin and the talk had been like wine
to a thirsty soul. In such an atmosphere a man
would have little time to&mdash;think. He craved the
action, the excitement, the uplift.</p>

<p>He came back to Eve's prattle. "I told Winifred
Ames we would come to her little supper after the
play. I was to have gone with her and Pip and
Jimmie Ford. Tony is away. But when you
'phoned, I called the first part of it off. I wanted
to have a little time just with you, Richard."</p>

<p>He smiled at her. "Who is Jimmie Ford?"</p>

<p>"A lovely youth who is in love with me&mdash;or
with my money&mdash;he was at your birthday party,
Dicky Boy; don't you remember?"</p>

<p>"The Blue Butterfly? Yes. Is he another victim,
Eve?"</p>

<p>She shrugged. "Who knows? If he is in love
with me, he'll get hurt; if he is in love with Aunt
Maude's money, he won't get it. Oh, how can a
woman know?" The lightness left her voice.
"Sometimes I think that I'll go off somewhere and
see if somebody won't love me for what I am, and
not for what he thinks Aunt Maude is going to
leave me."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>[<a href="./images/182.png">182</a>]</span>
"And you with a string of scalps at your belt,
and Pip ready at any moment to die for you."</p>

<p>She nodded. "Pip is pure gold. Nobody can
question his motives. And anyhow he has more
money than I can ever hope to have. But I am not
in love with him, Dicky."</p>

<p>"You are not in love with anybody. You are a
cold-blooded little thing, Eve. A man would need
much fire to melt your ice."</p>

<p>"Would he?"</p>

<p>"You know he would."</p>

<p>He swept away from her petulances to the thing
which was for the moment uppermost in his mind.
"I have had an offer, Eve, from Austin. He wants
an assistant, a younger man who can work into
his practice. It is a wonderful working opportunity."</p>

<p>"It would be wicked to throw it away," she told
him, breathlessly, "wicked, Richard."</p>

<p>"It looks that way. But there's mother to think
of, and Crossroads has come to mean a lot to me,
Eve."</p>

<p>"Oh, but New York, Dicky! Think of the good
times we'd have, and of your getting into Austin's
line of work and his patients. You would be rolling
in your own limousine before you'd know it."</p>

<p>Rolling in his own limousine! And missing
the rhythm of big Ben's measured trot&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>"<i>I think&mdash;she was the&mdash;most beautiful</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>[<a href="./images/183.png">183</a>]</span>
As they motored to Winifred's, Eve spoke of his
quiet mood. "Why don't you talk, Dicky?"</p>

<p>"It has been a busy day&mdash;I'll wake up presently
and realize that I am here."</p>

<p>It was before he went down-stairs at the Dutton-Ames
that he had a moment alone with Jimmie Ford.</p>

<p>Jimmie was not in the best of moods. Winifred
had asked him a week ago to join a choice quartette
which included Pip and Eve. Of course Meade
made a troublesome fourth, but Jimmie's conceit
saved him from realizing the real fact of the importance
of the plain and heavy Pip to that group.
And now, things had been shifted, so that Eve had
stayed to talk to a country doctor, and he had been
left to the callow company of an indefinite debutante
whom Winifred had invited to fill the vacancy.</p>

<p>"When did you come down, Brooks?" he asked
coldly.</p>

<p>"This morning."</p>

<p>"Nice old place of yours in Harford."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Owned it long?"</p>

<p>"Several generations."</p>

<p>"Oh, ancestral halls, and all that&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I saw Cynthia Warfield's picture on the wall&mdash;used
to know the family down in Carroll&mdash;our
old estates joined&mdash;Anne Warfield and I were
brought up together."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>[<a href="./images/184.png">184</a>]</span>
They had reached the head of the stairway. Richard
stopped and stood looking down. "Anne Warfield?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Surprised to find her teaching. I fancy
they've been pretty hard up&mdash;grandfather drank,
and all that, you know."</p>

<p>"I didn't know." It was now Richard's turn to
speak coldly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, ran through with all their money.
Years ago. Anne's a little queen. Engaged to her
once myself, you know. Boy and girl affair, broken
off&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Below them in the hall, Richard could see the
women with whom he was to sup. Shining, shimmering
figures in silk and satin and tulle. For
these, softness and ease of living. And that other
one! Oh, the cheap little gown, the braided hair!
Before he had known her she had been Jimmie's
and now she was Geoffrey's. And he had fatuously
thought himself the first.</p>

<p>He threw himself uproariously into the fun which
followed. After all, it was good to be with them
again, good to hear the familiar talk of people and
of things, good to eat and drink and be merry in
the fashion of the town, good to have this taste of
the old tumultuous life.</p>

<p>He and Eve went home together. Philip's honest
face clouded as he saw them off. "Don't run away
with her, Brooks," he said, as he leaned in to have a
last look at her. "Good-night, little lady."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>[<a href="./images/185.png">185</a>]</span>
"Good-night."</p>

<p>It was when they were motoring through the park
that Eve said, "I am troubled about Pip."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I sometimes have a feeling that he has a
string tied to me&mdash;and that he is pulling me&mdash;his
way. And I don't want to go. But I shall, if something
doesn't save me from him, Richard."</p>

<p>"You can save yourself."</p>

<p>"That's all you know about it. Women take
what they can get in this world, not what they
want. Every morning Pip sends me flowers, sweetheart
roses to-day, and lilies yesterday, and before
that gardenias and orchids, and when I open the
boxes every flower seems to be shouting, 'Come
and marry me, come and marry me.'"</p>

<p>"No woman need marry a man she doesn't care
for, Eve."</p>

<p>"Lots of them do."</p>

<p>"You won't. You are too sensible."</p>

<p>"Am I?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>She sighed a little. "I am not half as sensible as
you think."</p>

<p>When they reached home, they found Aunt Maude
before them. She had been unswathed from her
veil and her cloak, released from her black velvet, and
was comfortable before her sitting-room fire in a padded
wisteria robe and a boudoir cap with satin bow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>[<a href="./images/186.png">186</a>]</span>
Underneath the cap there were no flat gray curls.
These were whisked mysteriously away each night
by Hannah, the maid, to be returned in the morning,
fresh from their pins with no hurt to Aunt
Maude's old head.</p>

<p>She greeted Richard cordially. "I sent Hannah
down when I heard you. Eve didn't let me know
you were here; she never lets me know. And now
tell me about your poor mother."</p>

<p>"Why poor, dear lady? You know she loves
Crossroads."</p>

<p>"How anybody can&mdash;&mdash; I'd die of loneliness.
Now to-night&mdash;so many people of my own kind&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Everybody in black velvet or brocade, everybody
with badges, everybody with blue blood," Eve
interrupted flippantly; "nobody with ideas, nobody
with enthusiasms, nobody with an ounce of originality&mdash;ugh!"</p>

<p>"My dear&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Dicky, Aunt Maude's idea of Heaven is a place
where everybody wears coronets instead of halos,
and where the angel chorus is a Dutch version of
'God save the King.'"</p>

<p>"My idea of Heaven," Aunt Maude retorted, "is
a place where young girls have ladylike manners."</p>

<p>Richard roared. It had been long since he had
tasted this atmosphere of salt and spice. Aunt Maude
and her sprightly niece were as good as a play.</p>

<p>"How long shall you be in town, Richard?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>[<a href="./images/187.png">187</a>]</span>
"Three or four days. It depends on the condition
of our patient. It may be necessary to operate
again, and Austin wants me to be here."</p>

<p>"Aunt Maude, Dicky may come back to New
York to live."</p>

<p>"He should never have left. What does your
mother think of it?"</p>

<p>"I haven't told her of Austin's offer. I shall write
to-night."</p>

<p>"If she has a grain of sense, she'll make you
take it."</p>

<p>Eve was restless. "Come on down, Dicky. It is
time that Aunt Maude was in bed."</p>

<p>"I never go until you do, Eve, and in my day
young men went home before morning."</p>

<p>"Dearest, Dicky shall leave in ten minutes. I'll
send him."</p>

<p>But when they were once more in the great drawing-room,
she forgot the time limit. "Don't let
your mother settle things for you, Dicky. Think
of yourself and your future. Of your&mdash;manhood,
Dicky&mdash;please."</p>

<p>She was very lovely as she stood before him, with
her hands on his shoulders. "I want you to be the
biggest of them&mdash;all," she said, and her laugh was
tremulous.</p>

<p>"I know. Eve, I want to stay."</p>

<p>"Oh, Dicky&mdash;really?"</p>

<p>"Really, Eve."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>[<a href="./images/188.png">188</a>]</span>
Their hands came together in a warm clasp.</p>

<p>She let him go after that. There had been nothing
more than brotherly warmth in his manner, but
it was enough that in the days to come she was to
have him near her.</p>

<p>Richard, writing to his mother, told her something
of his state of mind. "I'll admit that it tempts
me. It is a big thing, a very big thing, to work
with a man like that. Yet knowing how you feel
about it, I dare not decide. We shall have to face
one thing, however. The Crossroads practice will
never be a money-making practice. I know how
little money means to you, but the lack of it will
mean that I shall be tied to rather small things as
the years go on. I should like to be one of the Big
Men, mother. You see I am being very frank. I'll
admit that I dreamed with you&mdash;of bringing all my
talents to the uplift of a small community, of reviving
at Crossroads the dignity of other days. But&mdash;perhaps
we have dreamed too much&mdash;the world
doesn't wait for the dreamers&mdash;the only way is to
join the procession."</p>

<p>In the day which intervened between his letter and
his mother's answer, he had breakfast with Eve in
the room with the flame-colored fishes and the parrot
and the green-eyed cat. He motored with Eve
out to Westchester, and they had lunch at an inn on
the side of a hill which overlooked the Hudson; later
they went to a matin&eacute;e, to tea in a special little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>[<a href="./images/189.png">189</a>]</span>
corner of a down-town hotel for the sake of old days,
then back again to dress for dinner at Eve's, with
Aunt Maude at the head of the table, and Tony and
Winifred and Pip completing the party. Then
another play, another supper, another ride home with
Eve, and in the morning in quiet contrast to all this,
his mother's letter.</p>

<p>"Dear Boy," she said, "I am glad you spoke to
me frankly of what you feel. I want no secrets between
us, no reservations, no sacrifices which in the
end may mean a barrier between us.</p>

<p>"Our sojourn at Crossroads has been an experiment.
And it has failed. I had hoped that as the
days went on, you might find happiness. Indeed, I
had been deceiving myself with the thought that you
were happy. But now I know that you are not, and
I know, too, what it must mean to you to feel that
from among all the others you have been chosen to
help a great man like Dr. Austin, who was the friend
of my father, and my friend through everything.</p>

<p>"But Richard, I can't go back. I literally crawled
to Crossroads, after my years in New York, as a
wounded animal seeks its lair. And I have a morbid
shrinking from it all, unworthy of me, perhaps,
but none the less impossible to overcome. I feel
that the very stones of the streets would speak of the
tragedy and dishonor of the past: houses would
stare at me, the crowds would shun me.</p>

<p>"And now I have this to propose. That I stay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>[<a href="./images/190.png">190</a>]</span>
here at Crossroads, keeping the old house open for
you. David is near me, and any one of Cousin
Mary Tyson's daughters would be glad to come to
me. And you shall run down at week-ends, and tell
me all about it, and I shall live in your letters and in
the things which you have to tell. We can be one
in spirit, even though there are miles between us.
This is the only solution which seems possible to me
at this moment. I cannot hold you back from what
may be your destiny. I can only pray here in my
old home for the happiness and success that must
come to you&mdash;my boy&mdash;my little&mdash;boy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The letter broke off there. Richard, high up in the
room of the big hotel, found himself pacing the
floor. Back of the carefully penned lines of his
mother's letter he could see her slender tense figure,
the whiteness of her face, the shadow in her eyes.
How often he had seen it when a boy, how often he
had sworn that when he was the master of the house
he would make her happy.</p>

<p>The telephone rang. It was Eve. "I was afraid
you might have left for the hospital."</p>

<p>"I am leaving in a few minutes."</p>

<p>"Can you go for a ride with me?"</p>

<p>"In the afternoon. There's to be another operation&mdash;it
may be very late before I am through."</p>

<p>"Not too late for dinner out of town somewhere
and a ride under the May moon." Her voice rang
high and happy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>[<a href="./images/191.png">191</a>]</span>
For the rest of the morning he had no time to
think of his own affairs. The operation was extremely
rare and interesting, and Austin's skill was
superb. Richard felt as if he were taking part in a
play, in which the actors were the white clad and
competent doctors and nurses, and the stage was
the surgical room.</p>

<p>Eve coming for him, found him tired and taciturn.
She respected his mood, and said little, and they
rode out and out from the town and up and up into
the Westchester hills, dotted with dogwood, pink and
white like huge nosegays. As the night came on
there was the fragrance of the gardens, the lights of
the little towns; then once more the shadows as they
swept again into the country.</p>

<p>"We will go as far as we dare," Eve said. "I
know an adorable place to dine."</p>

<p>She tried more than once to bring him to speak
of Austin, but he put her off. "I am dead tired, dear
girl; you talk until we have something to eat."</p>

<p>"Oh," Eve surveyed him scornfully, "oh, men
and their appetites!"</p>

<p>But she had a thousand things to tell him, and her
light chatter carried him away from somber thoughts,
so that when they reached at last the quaint hostelry
toward which their trip had tended, he was ready to
meet Eve's mood half-way, and enter with some zest
upon their gay adventure. She chose a little table
on a side porch, where they were screened from ob<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>[<a href="./images/192.png">192</a>]</span>servation,
and which overlooked the river, and there
took off her hat and powdered her nose, and gave
her attention to the selection of the dinner.</p>

<p>"A clear soup, Dicky Boy, and Maryland chicken,
hot asparagus, a Russian dressing for our lettuce,
and at the end red raspberries with little cakes.
They are sponge cakes, Dicky, filled with cream,
and they are food for the gods."</p>

<p>He was hungry and tired and he wanted to eat.
He was glad when the food came on.</p>

<p>When he finished he leaned back and talked shop.
"If you don't like it," he told Eve, "I'll stop. Some
women hate it."</p>

<p>"I love it," Eve said. "Dicky, when I dream of
your future you are always at the top of things, with
smaller men running after you and taking your
orders."</p>

<p>He smiled. "Don't dream. It doesn't pay. I've
stopped."</p>

<p>She glanced at him. His face was stern.</p>

<p>"What's up, Dicky Boy?"</p>

<p>He laughed without mirth. "Oh, I'm beginning
to think we are puppets pulled by strings; that
things happen as Fate wills and not as we want
them."</p>

<p>"Men haven't any right to talk that way. It's
their world. If you were a woman you might complain.
Look at me! Everything that I have comes
from Aunt Maude. She could leave me without a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>[<a href="./images/193.png">193</a>]</span>
cent if she chose, and she knows it. She owns me,
and unless I marry she'll own me until I die."</p>

<p>"You'll marry, Eve. Old Pip will see to that."</p>

<p>"Pip," passionately. "Dicky, why do you always
fling Pip in my face?"</p>

<p>"Eve&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"You do. Everybody does. And I don't want
him."</p>

<p>"Then don't have him. There are others. And
you needn't lose your temper over a little thing like
that."</p>

<p>"It isn't a little thing."</p>

<p>"Oh, well&mdash;&mdash;" The conversation lapsed into
silence until Eve said, "I was horrid&mdash;and I think
we had better be getting back, Dicky."</p>

<p>Again in the big limousine, with the stolid chauffeur
separated from them by the glass screen, she
said, softly, "Oh, Dicky, it seems too good to be
true that we shall have other nights like this&mdash;other
rides. When will you come up for good?"</p>

<p>"I am not coming, Eve."</p>

<p>She turned to him, her face frozen into whiteness.</p>

<p>"Not coming? Why not?"</p>

<p>"While mother lives I must make her happy."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be goody-goody."</p>

<p>He blazed. "I'm not."</p>

<p>"You are. Aren't you ever going to live your
own life?"</p>

<p>"I am living it. But I can't break mother's heart."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>[<a href="./images/194.png">194</a>]</span>
"You might as well break hers as&mdash;mine."</p>

<p>He stared down at her. Mingled forever after
with his thoughts of that moment was a blurred
vision of her whiteness and stillness. Her slim
hands were crossed tensely on her knees.</p>

<p>He laid one of his own awkwardly over them.
"Dear girl," he said, "you don't in the least mean it."</p>

<p>"I do. Dicky, why shouldn't I say it? Why
shouldn't I? Hasn't a woman the right? Hasn't
she?"</p>

<p>She was shaking with silent sobs, the tears running
down her cheeks. He had not seen her cry
like this since little girlhood, when her mother had
died, and he, a clumsy lad, had tried to comfort her.</p>

<p>He was faced by a situation so stupendous that
for a moment he sat there stunned. Proud little
Eve for love of him had made the supreme sacrifice
of her pride. Could any man in his maddest moment
have imagined a thing like this&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>He bent down to her, and took her hands in his.</p>

<p>"Hush, Eve, hush. I can't bear to see you cry.
I'm not the fellow to make you happy, dear."</p>

<p>Her head dropped against his shoulder. The
perfumed gold of her hair was against his cheeks.
"No one else can make me happy, Dicky."</p>

<p>Then he felt the world whirl about him, and it
seemed to him as he answered that his voice came
from a long distance.</p>

<p>"If you'll marry me, Eve, I'll stay."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>[<a href="./images/195.png">195</a>]</span>
It was the knightly thing to do, and the necessary
thing. Yet as they swept on through the night, his
mother's face, all the joy struck from it, seemed to
stare at him out of the darkness.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3><i>In Which Geoffrey Plays Cave Man.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Mine own uncle:</span></p>

<p>I don't know whether to begin at the beginning
or at the end of what I have to tell you. And
even now as I think back over the events of the last
twenty-four hours I feel that I must have dreamed
them, and that I will wake and find that nothing has
really happened.</p>

<p>But something has happened, and "of a strangeness"
which makes it seem to belong to some of those
queer old dime "thrillers" which you never wanted
me to read.</p>

<p>Last night Geoffrey Fox asked me to go out with
him on the river. I don't often go at night, yet
as there was a moon, it seemed as if I might.</p>

<p>We went in Brinsley Tyson's motor boat. It is
big and roomy and is equipped with everything to
make one comfortable for extended trips. I wondered
a little that Geoffrey should take it, for he has
a little boat of his own, but he said that Mr. Tyson
had offered it, and they had been out in it all day.</p>

<p>Well, it was lovely on the water; I was feeling
tired and as blue as blue&mdash;some day I may tell you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>[<a href="./images/197.png">197</a>]</span>
about <i>that</i>, Uncle Rod, and I was glad of the quiet
and beauty of it all; and of late Geoffrey and I
have been such good friends.</p>

<p>Can't you ever really know people, Uncle Rod, or
am I so dull and stupid that I misunderstand? Men
are such a puzzle&mdash;all except you, you darling
dear&mdash;and if you were young and not my uncle,
even you might be as much of a puzzle as the rest.</p>

<p>Well, I would never have believed it of Geoffrey
Fox, and even now I can't really feel that he was responsible.
But it isn't what I think but what you will
think that is important&mdash;for I have, somehow, ceased
to believe in myself.</p>

<p>It was when we reached the second bridge that I
told Geoffrey that we must turn back. We had,
even then, gone farther than I had intended. But
as we started up-stream, I felt that we would get to
Bower's before Peter went back on the bridge, which
is always the signal for the house to close, although
it is never really closed; but the lights are turned
down and the family go to bed, and I have always
known that I ought not to stay out after that.</p>

<p>Well, just as we left the second bridge, something
happened to the motor.</p>

<p>Uncle Rod, <i>that was last night</i>, and I didn't get
back to Bower's until a few hours ago, and here is
the whole truth before I write any more&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Geoffrey Fox tried to run away with me!</i></p>

<p>It would seem like a huge joke if it were not so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>[<a href="./images/198.png">198</a>]</span>
serious. I don't know how he got such an idea in
his head. Perhaps he thought that life was like one
of his books&mdash;that all he had to do was to plan a
plot, and then make it work out in his own way. He
said, in that first awful moment, when I knew what
he had done, "I thought I could play Cave Man
and get away with it." You see, he hadn't taken
into consideration that I wasn't a Cave Woman!</p>

<p>When the engine first went wrong I wasn't in the
least worried. He fixed it, and we went on. Then
it stopped and we drifted: the moon went down and
it was cold, and finally Geoffrey made me curl up
among the cushions. I felt that it must be very
late, but Geoffrey showed me his watch, and it was
only a little after ten. I knew Peter wouldn't be
going to the bridge until eleven, and I hoped by
that time we would be home.</p>

<p>But we weren't. We were far, far down the river.
At last I gave up hope of arriving before the house
closed, but I knew that I could explain to Mrs.
Bower.</p>

<p>After that I napped and nodded, for I was very
tired, and all the time Geoffrey tinkered with the
broken motor. Each time that I waked I asked
questions but he always quieted me&mdash;and at last&mdash;as
the dawn began to light the world, a pale gray
spectral sort of light, Uncle Rod, I saw that the
shore on one side of us was not far away, but on the
other it was a mere dark line in the distance&mdash;double<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>[<a href="./images/199.png">199</a>]</span>
the width that the river is at Bower's. Geoffrey was
standing up and steering toward a little pier that
stuck its nose into shallow water. Back of the pier
was what seemed to be an old warehouse, and in a
clump of trees back of that there was a thin church
spire.</p>

<p>I said, "Where are we?" and he said, "I am not
sure, but I am going in to see if I can get the motor
mended."</p>

<p>I couldn't think of anything but how worried the
Bowers would be. "You must find a telephone," I
told him, "and call Beulah, and let her know what
has happened."</p>

<p>He ran up to the landing and fastened the boat,
and then he helped me out. "We will sit here and
have a bit of breakfast first," he said; "there's some
coffee left in Brinsley's hot and cold bottle, and
some supplies under the stern seat."</p>

<p>It was really quite cheerful sitting there, eating sardines
and crackers and olives and orange marmalade.
A fresh breeze was blowing, and the river was
wrinkled all over its silver surface, and we could see
nothing but water ahead of us, straight to the
horizon, where there was just the faint streak of a
steamer's smoke.</p>

<p>"We must be almost in the Bay," I said.
"Couldn't you have steered up-stream instead of
down?"</p>

<p>He sat very still for a moment looking at me, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>[<a href="./images/200.png">200</a>]</span>
then he said quickly and sharply, "I didn't want to
go up-stream. I wanted to go down. And I came
in here because I saw a church spire, and where
there is a church there is always a preacher. Will
you marry me, Mistress Anne?"</p>

<p>At first I thought that he had lost his mind.
Uncle Rod, I don't think that I shall ever see a
sardine or a cracker without a vision of Geoffrey
with his breakfast in his hand and his face as white
as chalk above it.</p>

<p>"That's a very silly joke," I said. "Why should
I marry you?"</p>

<p>He looked at me, and&mdash;I didn't need any answer,
for it came to me then that I had been out all night
on the river with him, and that he was thinking of a
way to quiet people's tongues!</p>

<p>I tried to speak, but my voice shook, and finally I
managed to stammer that when we got back I was
sure it would be all right.</p>

<p>"It won't be all right," he said; "the world will
have things to say about you, and I'd rather die
than have them say it. And I could make you
happy, Anne."</p>

<p>Then I told him that I did not love him, that he
was my dear friend, my brother&mdash;and suddenly his
face grew red, and he came over and caught hold of
my hands. "I am not your brother," he said. "I
want you whether you want me or not. I could
make you love me&mdash;I've got to have you in my life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>[<a href="./images/201.png">201</a>]</span>
I am not going on alone to meet darkness&mdash;and
despair."</p>

<p>Oh, Uncle Rod, then I knew and I looked straight
at him and asked: "Geoffrey Fox, did you break the
motor?"</p>

<p>"It isn't broken," he said; "there has never been
a thing the matter with it."</p>

<p>I think for the first time that I was a little afraid.
Not of him, but of what he had done.</p>

<p>"Oh, how could you," I said, "how could you?"</p>

<p>And it was then that he said, "I thought that I
could play Cave Man and get away with it."</p>

<p>After that he told me how much he cared. He
said that I had helped him and inspired him. That
I had shown him a side of himself that no one else
had ever shown. That I had made him believe in
himself&mdash;and in&mdash;God. That if he didn't have me
in his life his future would be&mdash;dead. He begged
and begged me to let him take me into the little
town and find some one to marry us. He said that
if we went back I would be lost to him&mdash;that&mdash;that
Brooks would get me&mdash;that was the way he put it,
Uncle Rod. He said that he was going blind; that
I hadn't any heart; that he would love me as no one
else could; that he would write his books for me;
that he would spend his whole life making it up
to me.</p>

<p>I don't know how I held out against him. But I
did. Something in me seemed to say that I must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>[<a href="./images/202.png">202</a>]</span>
hold out. Some sense of dignity and of self-respect,
and at last I conquered.</p>

<p>"I will not marry you," I said; "don't speak of
it again. I am going back to Bower's. I am not a
heroine of a melodrama, and there's no use to act as
if I had done an unpardonable thing. I haven't, and
the Bowers won't think it, and nobody else will
know. But you have hurt me more than I can tell
by what you have done to-night. When you first
came to Bower's there were things about you that I
didn't like, but&mdash;as I came to know you, I thought
I had found another man in you. The night at the
Crossroads ball you seemed like a big kind brother&mdash;and
I told you what I had suffered, and now you
have made me suffer."</p>

<p>And then&mdash;oh, I don't quite know how to tell you.
He dropped on his knees at my feet and hid his face
in my dress and cried&mdash;hard dry sobs&mdash;with his
hands clutching.</p>

<p>I just couldn't stand it, Uncle Rod, and presently
I was saying, "Oh, you poor boy, you poor
boy&mdash;&mdash;" and I think I smoothed his hair, and he
whispered, "Can't you?" and I said, "Oh, Geoffrey,
I can't."</p>

<p>At last he got control of himself. He sat at a
little distance from me and told me what he was
going to do.</p>

<p>"I think I was mad," he said. "I can't even ask
your forgiveness, for I don't deserve it. I am going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>[<a href="./images/203.png">203</a>]</span>
up to town to telephone to Beulah, and when I come
back I will take you up the river where you can get
the train. I shall break the engine and leave it
here, so that when Brinsley gets it back there will
be nothing to spoil our story."</p>

<p>He was gone half an hour. When he came he
brought me a hat. He had bought it at the one
little store where he had telephoned, and he had
bought one for himself. I think we both laughed a
little when we put them on, although it wasn't a
laughing matter, but we did look funny.</p>

<p>He unfastened the boat, and we turned up the
river and in about an hour we came into quite a
thriving port with the Sunday quiet over everything,
and Geoffrey did things to the engine that put it out
of commission, and then he left it with a man on the
pier, and we took the train.</p>

<p>It seems that all night at Bower's they were looking
for us. They even took other boats, and followed.
And they called. I know that if Geoffrey
heard them call he didn't answer.</p>

<p>Every one seemed to accept our explanation.
Perhaps they thought it queer. But I can't help
that.</p>

<p>Geoffrey is going away to-morrow. When we
were alone in the hall for a moment he told me that
he was going. "If you can ever forgive me," he
said, "will you write and tell me? What I have
done may seem unforgivable. But when a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>[<a href="./images/204.png">204</a>]</span>
dreams a great deal he sometimes thinks that he
can make his dreams come true."</p>

<p>Uncle Rod, I think the worst thing in the whole
wide world is to be disappointed in people. As soon
as school closes I am coming back to you. Perhaps
you can make me see the sunsets. And what
do you say about life now? Is it what we make it?
Did I have anything to do with this mad adventure?
Yet the memory of it will always&mdash;smirch.</p>

<p>And if life isn't what we make it, where is our
hope and where are our sunsets? Tell me that, you
old dear.</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</p>

<p>P.S. When I opened my door just now, I found
that Geoffrey had left on the threshold his little Napoleon,
and a letter. I am sending the letter to you.
I cried over it, and I am afraid it is blurred&mdash;but I
haven't time to make a copy before the mail goes.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>What Geoffrey said:</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="smcap">My little Child:</span></p>

<p>I am calling you that because there is something
so young and untouched about you. If I were
an artist I should paint you as young Psyche&mdash;and
there should be a hint of angels' wings in the air
and it should be spring&mdash;with a silver dawn. But if
I could paint should I ever be able to put on canvas
the light in your eyes when you have talked to me
by the fire, my kind little friend whom I have lost?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>[<a href="./images/205.png">205</a>]</span>
I cannot even now understand the mood that possessed
me. Yet I will be frank. I saw you go into
the wood with Richard Brooks. I felt that if he
should say to you what I was sure he wanted to say
that there would be no chance for me&mdash;so I hurried
after you. The thing which was going to happen
must not happen; and I arrived in time. After that
I told Brooks as we walked back that I was going
to marry you, and I took you out in my boat intending
to make my words come true.</p>

<p>These last few days have been strange days.
Perhaps when I have described them you may find
it in your heart to feel sorry for me. The book is
finished. That of itself has left me with a sense of
loss, as if I had put away from me something that
had been a part of me. Then&mdash;I am going blind.
Do you know what that means, the desperate meaning?
To lose the light out of your life&mdash;never to see
the river as I saw it this morning? Never to see the
moonlight or the starlight&mdash;never to see your face?</p>

<p>The specialist has given me a few months&mdash;and
then darkness.</p>

<p>Was it selfishness to want to tie you to a blind
man? If you knew that you were losing the light
wouldn't you want to steal a star to illumine the
night?&mdash;and you were my&mdash;Star.</p>

<p>I am going now to my little sister, Mimi. She
leaves the convent in a few days. There are just the
two of us. I have been a wayward chap, loving my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>[<a href="./images/206.png">206</a>]</span>
own way; it will be a sorry thing for her to find, I
fancy, that henceforth I shall be in leading strings.</p>

<p>It is because of this thing that is coming that I
am begging you still to be my friend&mdash;to send me
now and then a little letter; that I may feel in the
night that you are holding out your hand to me.
There can be no greater punishment than your complete
silence, no greater purgatory than the thought
that I have forfeited your respect. Looking into the
future I can see no way to regain it, but if the day
ever comes when a Blind Beggar can serve you, you
will show that you have forgiven him by asking that
service of him.</p>

<p>I am leaving my little Napoleon for you. You
once called him a little great man. Perhaps those
of us who have some elements of greatness find our
balance in something that is small and mean and
mad.</p>

<p>Will you tell Brooks that you are not bound to me
in any way? It is best that you should do it. I
shall hope for a line from you. If it does not come&mdash;if
I have indeed lost my little friend through my own
fault&mdash;then indeed the shadows will shut me in.</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Geoffrey.</span>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Uncle Rodman writes:</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="smcap">My beloved Niece:</span></p>

<p>Once upon a time you and I read together
"The Arabian Nights," and when we had finished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>[<a href="./images/207.png">207</a>]</span>
the first book you laid your little hand on my knee
and looked up at me. "Is it true, Uncle Rod?"
you asked. "Oh, Uncle Rod, is it true?" And I
said, "What it tells about the Roc's egg and the
Old Man of the Sea and the Serpent is not true, but
what it says about the actions and motives of people
is true, because people have acted in that way and
have thought like that through all the ages, and
the tales have lived because of it, and have been
written in all languages." I was sure, when I said it,
that you did not quite understand; but you were to
grow to it, which was all that was required.</p>

<p>Blessed child, what your Geoffrey Fox has done,
though I hate him for it and blame him, is what other
hotheads have done. The protective is not the
primitive masculine instinct. Men have thought of
themselves first and of women afterward since the
beginning of time. Only with Christianity was
chivalry born in them. And since many of our
youths have elected to be pagan, what can you
expect?</p>

<p>So your Geoffrey Fox being pagan, primitive&mdash;primordial,
whatever it is now the fashion to call it,
reverted to type, and you were the victim.</p>

<p>I have read his letter and might find it in my heart
to forgive him were it not that he has made you suffer;
but that I cannot forgive; although, indeed, his
coming blindness is something that pleads for him,
and his fear of it&mdash;and his fear of losing you.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>[<a href="./images/208.png">208</a>]</span>
I am glad that you are coming home to me.
Margaret and her family are going away, and we
can have their big house to ourselves during the
summer. We shall like that, I am sure, and we shall
have many talks, and try to straighten out this matter
of dreams&mdash;and of sunsets, which is really very
important, and not in the least to be ignored.</p>

<p>But let me leave this with you to ponder on. You
remember how you have told me that when you were
a tiny child you walked once between me and my
good old friend, General Ross, and you heard it said
by one of us that life was what we made it. Before that
you had always cried when it rained; now you were
anxious that the rain might come so that you could
see if you could really keep from crying. And when
the rain arrived you were so immensely entertained
that you didn't shed a tear, and you went to bed that
night feeling like a conqueror, and never again cried
out against the elements.</p>

<p>It would have been dreadful if all your life you
had gone on crying about rain, wouldn't it? And
isn't this adventure your rainy day? You rose
above it, dearest child. I am proud of the way you
handled your mad lover.</p>

<p>Life <i>is</i> what we make it. Never doubt that.
"He knows the water best who has waded through
it," and I have lived long and have learned my lesson.
When I knew that I could paint no more
real pictures I knew that I must have dream pic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>[<a href="./images/209.png">209</a>]</span>tures
to hang on the walls of memory. Shall I
make you a little catalogue of them, dear heart&mdash;thus:</p>

<p>No. 1.&mdash;Your precious mother sewing by the west
window in our shadowed sitting-room, her head
haloed by the sunset.</p>

<p>No. 2.&mdash;Anne in a blue pinafore, with the wind
blowing her hair back on a gray March morning.</p>

<p>No. 3.&mdash;Anne in a white frock amid a blur of
candle-light on Christmas&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Oh, my list would be long! People have said
that I have lacked pride because I have chosen to
take my troubles philosophically. There have been
times when my soul has wept. I have cried often
on my rainy days. But&mdash;there have always been
the sunsets&mdash;and after that&mdash;the stars.</p>

<p>I fear that I have been but little help to you. But
you know my love&mdash;blessed one. And the eagerness
with which I await your coming. Ever your
own</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3><i>In Which There is Much Said of Marriage and of
Giving in Marriage.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Eve's</span> green-eyed cat sat on a chair and watched
the flame-colored fishes. It was her morning
amusement. When her mistress came down she
would have her cream and her nap. In the meantime,
the flashing, golden things in the clear water
aroused an ancient instinct. She reached out a quick
paw and patted the water, flinging showers of sparkling
drops on her sleek fur.</p>

<p>Aunt Maude, eating waffles and reading her morning
paper, approved her. "I hope you'll catch
them," she said, "especially the turtles and the tadpoles&mdash;the
idea of having such things where you
eat."</p>

<p>The green-eyed cat licked her wet paw, then she
jumped down from the chair and trotted to the
door to meet Eve, who picked her up and hugged
her. "Pats," she demanded, "what have you been
doing? Your little pads are wet."</p>

<p>"She's been fishing," said Aunt Maude, "in your
aquarium. She has more sense than I thought."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>[<a href="./images/211.png">211</a>]</span>
Eve, pouring cream into a crystal dish, laughed.
"Pats is as wise as the ages&mdash;you can see it in her
eyes. She doesn't say anything, she just looks.
Women ought to follow her example. It's the mysterious,
the silent, that draws men. Now Polly
prattles and prattles, and nobody listens, and we
all get a little tired of her; don't we, Polly?"</p>

<p>She set the cream carefully by the green cushion,
and Pats, classically posed on her haunches, lapped
it luxuriously. The Polly-parrot coaxed and wheedled
and was rewarded with her morning biscuit.
The flame-colored fishes rose to the snowy particles
which Eve strewed on the surface of the water, and
then with all of her family fed, Eve turned to the
table, sat down, and pulled away Aunt Maude's
paper.</p>

<p>"My dear," the old lady protested.</p>

<p>"I want to talk to you," Eve announced. "Aunt
Maude, I'm going to marry Dicky."</p>

<p>Aunt Maude pushed back her plate of waffles.
The red began to rise in her cheeks. "Oh, of all
the fools&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'He who calleth his brother a fool&mdash;&mdash;'" Eve
murmured pensively. "Aunt Maude, I'm in love
with him."</p>

<p>"You're in love with yourself," tartly, "and with
having your own way. The husband for you is
Philip Meade. But he wants you, and so&mdash;you
don't want him."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>[<a href="./images/212.png">212</a>]</span>
"Dicky wants me, too," Eve said, a little wistfully;
"you mustn't forget that, Aunt Maude."</p>

<p>"I'm not forgetting it." Then sharply, "Shall
you go to live at Crossroads?"</p>

<p>"No. Austin has made him an offer. He's coming
back to town."</p>

<p>"What do you expect to live on?"</p>

<p>Silence. Then, uncertainly, "I thought perhaps
until he gets on his feet you'd make us an allowance."</p>

<p>The old lady exploded in a short laugh. She
gathered up her paper and her spectacles case and
her bag of fancy work. Then she rose. "Not if
you marry Richard Brooks. You may as well know
that now as later, Eve. All your life you have
shaken the plum tree and have gathered the fruit.
You may come to your senses when you find there
isn't any tree to shake."</p>

<p>The deep red in the cheeks of the old woman was
matched by the red that stained Eve's fairness.
"Keep your money," she said, passionately; "I
can get along without it. You've always made me
feel like a pauper, Aunt Maude."</p>

<p>The old woman's hand went up. There was
about her a dignity not to be ignored. "I think
you are saying more than you mean, Eve. I have
tried to be generous."</p>

<p>They were much alike as they faced each other,
the same clear cold eyes, the same set of the head,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>[<a href="./images/213.png">213</a>]</span>
the only difference Eve's youth and slenderness and
radiant beauty. Perhaps in some far distant past
Aunt Maude had been like Eve. Perhaps in some
far distant future Eve's soft lines would stiffen into a
second edition of Aunt Maude.</p>

<p>"I have tried to be generous," Aunt Maude repeated.</p>

<p>"You have been. I shouldn't have said that.
But, Aunt Maude, it hasn't been easy to eat the
bread of dependence."</p>

<p>"You are feeling that now," said the old lady
shrewdly, "because you are ready for the great
adventure of being poor with your young Richard.
Well, try it. You'll wish more than once that you
were back with your old&mdash;plum tree."</p>

<p>Flash of eye met flash of eye. "I shall never ask
for another penny," Eve declared.</p>

<p>"I shall buy your trousseau, of course, and set
you up in housekeeping, but when a woman is
married her husband must take care of her." And
Aunt Maude sailed away with her bag and her
spectacles and her morning paper, and Eve was left
alone in the black and white breakfast room, where
Pats slept on her green cushion, the Polly-parrot
swung in her ring, and the flame-colored fishes hung
motionless in the clear water.</p>

<p>Eve ate no breakfast. She sat with her chin in
her hand and tried to think it out. Aunt Maude had
not proved tractable, and Richard's income would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a>[<a href="./images/214.png">214</a>]</span>
be small. Never having known poverty, she was
not appalled by the prospect of it. Her imagination
cast a glamour over the future. She saw herself
making a home for Richard. She saw herself
inviting Pip and Winifred Ames and Tony to small
suppers and perfectly served little dinners. She did
not see herself washing dishes or cooking the meals.
Knowing nothing of the day's work, how could she
conceive its sordidness?</p>

<p>She roused herself presently to go and write notes
to her friends. Triumphant notes which told of her
happiness.</p>

<p>Her note to Pip brought him that night. He
came in white-faced. As she went toward him, he
rose to meet her and caught her hands in a hard
grip, looking down at her. "You're mine, Eve.
Do you think I am going to let any one else have
you?"</p>

<p>"Don't be silly, Pip."</p>

<p>"Is it silly to say that there will never be for me
any other woman? I shall love you until I die. If
that is foolishness, I never want to be wise."</p>

<p>He was kissing her hands now.</p>

<p>"Don't, Pip, <i>don't</i>."</p>

<p>She wrenched herself away from him, and stood
as it were at bay. "You'll get over it."</p>

<p>"Shall I? How little you know me, Eve. I
haven't even given you up. If I were a story-book
sort of hero I'd bestow my blessing on you and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>[<a href="./images/215.png">215</a>]</span>
Brooks and go and drive an ambulance in France,
and break my heart at long distance. But I shan't.
I shall stay right here on the job, and see that
Brooks doesn't get you."</p>

<p>"Pip, I didn't think you were so&mdash;small."</p>

<p>The telephone rang. Eve answered it. "It was
Winifred to wish me happiness," she said, as she
came in from the hall.</p>

<p>She was blushing faintly. He gave her a keen
glance. "What else did she say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"You're fibbing. Tell me the truth, Eve."</p>

<p>She yielded to his masterfulness.</p>

<p>"Well, she said&mdash;'I wanted it to be Pip.'"</p>

<p>"Good old Win, I'll send her a bunch of roses."
He wandered restlessly about the room, then came
back to her. "Why, Eve, I planned the house&mdash;our
house. It was to have the sea in front of it and a
forest behind it, and your room was to have a wide
window and a balcony, and under the balcony there
was to be a rose garden."</p>

<p>"How sure you were of me, Pip."</p>

<p>"I have never been sure. But what I want, I&mdash;get.
Remember that, dear girl. When I shut my
eyes I can see you at the head of my table, in a high
gold chair&mdash;like a throne."</p>

<p>She stared at him in amazement. "Pip, it
doesn't sound a bit like you."</p>

<p>"No. What a man thinks is apt to be&mdash;different.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>[<a href="./images/216.png">216</a>]</span>
On the surface I'm a rather practical sort of fellow.
But when I plan my future with you I am playing
king to your queen, and I'm not half bad at it."</p>

<p>And now it was she who was restless. "If I married
you, what would I get out of it but&mdash;money?"</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>"You know I don't mean it that way. But I like
to think that I can help Richard&mdash;in his career."</p>

<p>"You're not made of that kind of stuff. You
want your own good time. Women who help men
to achieve must be content to lose their looks and
their figures and to do without pretty clothes, and
you wouldn't be content. You want to live your own
life, and be admired and petted and envied, Eve."</p>

<p>She faced him, blazing. "You and Aunt Maude
and Win are all alike. You think I can't be happy
unless I live in the lap of luxury. Well, I can tell
you this, I'd rather have a crust of bread with
Richard than live in a palace with you, Pip."</p>

<p>He stood up. "You don't mean it. But you
needn't have put it quite that way, and some day
you'll be sorry, and you'll tell me that you're sorry.
Tell me now, Eve."</p>

<p>He put his hands on her shoulders, holding her
with a masterful grip. Her eyes met his and fell.
"Oh, I hate your&mdash;sureness."</p>

<p>"Some day you are going to love it. Look at
me, Eve."</p>

<p>She forced herself to do so. But she was not at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>[<a href="./images/217.png">217</a>]</span>
ease. Then almost wistfully she yielded. "I&mdash;am
sorry, Pip."</p>

<p>His hands dropped from her shoulders. "Good
little girl."</p>

<p>He kissed both of her hands before he went away.
"I am glad we are friends"&mdash;that was his way of
putting it&mdash;"and you mustn't forget that some day
we are going to be more than that," and when he
had gone she found herself still shaken by the sureness
of his attitude.</p>

<p>Pip on his way down-town stopped in to order
Winifred's roses, and the next day he went to her
apartment and unburdened his heart.</p>

<p>"If it was in the day of duels I'd call him out.
Just at this moment I am in the mood for pistols or
poison, I'm not sure which."</p>

<p>"Why not try&mdash;patience?"</p>

<p>He glanced at her quickly. "You think she'll
tire?"</p>

<p>"I think&mdash;it can never happen. For Richard's
sake I&mdash;hope not."</p>

<p>"Why for his sake?"</p>

<p>Winifred smiled. "I'd like to see him marry
little Anne."</p>

<p>"The school-teacher?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Oh, I am broken-hearted to think he's
spoiling Nancy's dreams for him. There was something
so idyllic in them. And now he'll marry Eve."</p>

<p>"You say that as if it were a tragedy."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a>[<a href="./images/218.png">218</a>]</span>
"It is, for him and for her. Eve was never made
to be poor."</p>

<p>"Don't tell her that. She took my head off.
Said she'd rather have a crust of bread with Richard&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, oh!"</p>

<p>"Than a palace with me."</p>

<p>"Poor Pip. It wasn't nice of her."</p>

<p>"I shall make her eat her words."</p>

<p>Winifred shook her head. "Don't be hard on
her, Pip. We women are so helpless in our loves.
Richard might make her happy if he cared enough,
but he doesn't. Perhaps Eve will be broadened and
deepened by it all. I don't know. No one knows."</p>

<p>"I know this. That you and Tony seem to get a
lot out of things, Win."</p>

<p>"Of marriage? We do. Yet we've had all of
the little antagonisms and differences. But underneath
it we know&mdash;that we're made for each other.
And that helps. It has helped us to push the wrong
things out of our lives and to hold on to the right
ones."</p>

<p>Philip's young face was set. "I wanted to have
my chance with Eve. We are young and pretty
light-weight on the surface, but life together might
make us a bit more like you and Tony. And now
Richard is spoiling things."</p>

<p>Back at Crossroads, Nancy was trying to convince
her son that he was not spoiling things for her. "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>[<a href="./images/219.png">219</a>]</span>
have always been such a dreamer, dear boy. It was
silly for me to think that I could stand between you
and your big future. I have written to Sulie Tyson,
and she'll stay with me, and you can run down for
week-ends&mdash;and I'll always have David."</p>

<p>"Mother, let me go to Eve and tell her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell her what?"</p>

<p>"That I shall stay&mdash;with you."</p>

<p>She was white with the whiteness which had never
left her since he had told her that he was going to
marry Eve.</p>

<p>"Hickory-Dickory, if I kept you here in the end
you would hate me."</p>

<p>"<i>Mother!</i>"</p>

<p>"Not consciously. But I should be a barrier&mdash;and
you'd find yourself wishing for&mdash;freedom. If I
let you go&mdash;you'll come back now and then&mdash;and
be&mdash;glad."</p>

<p>He gathered her up in his arms and declared
fiercely that he would not leave her, but she stayed
firm. And so the thing was settled, and as soon as
he could settle his affairs at Crossroads he was to go
to Austin.</p>

<p>Anne, writing to Uncle Rod about it, said:</p>

<p>"St. Michael is to marry the Lily-of-the-Field.
You see, after all, he likes that kind of thing, though
I had fancied that he did not. She is not as fine
and simple as he is, and somehow I can't help feeling
sorry.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>[<a href="./images/220.png">220</a>]</span>
"But that isn't the worst of it, Uncle Bobs. He
is going back to New York. And now what becomes
of <i>his</i> sunsets? I don't believe he ever had
any. And oh, his poor little mother. She is fooling
him and making him think that it is just as it should
be and that she was foolish to expect anything else.
But to me it is unspeakable that he should leave
her. But he'll have Eve Chesley. Think of changing
Nancy Brooks for Eve!"</p>

<p>It was at Beulah's wedding that Anne and Richard
saw each other for the last time before his departure.</p>

<p>Beulah was married in the big front room at
Bower's. She was married at six o'clock because it
was easy for the farmer folk to come at that time,
and because the evening could be given up afterward
to the reception and a big supper and Beulah
and Eric could take the ten o'clock train for New
York.</p>

<p>She had no bridesmaids except Peggy, who was
quite puffed up with the importance of her office.
Anne had instructed her, and at the last moment held
a rehearsal on the side porch.</p>

<p>"Now, play I am the bride, Peggy."</p>

<p>"You look like a bride," Peggy said. "Aren't
you ever going to be a bride, Miss Anne?"</p>

<p>"I am not sure, Peggy. Perhaps no one will ever
ask me."</p>

<p>"I'd ask you if I were a man," Peggy reassured
her. "Now, go on and show me, Anne."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a>[<a href="./images/221.png">221</a>]</span>
"You must take Beulah's bouquet when she hands
it to you, and after she is married you must give it
back to her, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And then I must kiss her."</p>

<p>"You must let Eric kiss her first."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because he will be her husband."</p>

<p>"But I've been her sister for ever and ever."</p>

<p>"Oh, but a husband, Peggy. Husbands are <i>very</i>
important."</p>

<p>"Why are they?"</p>

<p>"Well, they give you a new name and a new
house, and you have new clothes to marry them in,
and you go away with them on a honeymoon."</p>

<p>"What's a honeymoon?"</p>

<p>"The honey is for the sweetness, and the moon is
for the madness, Peggy, dear."</p>

<p>"Do people always go away on trains for their
honeymoons?"</p>

<p>"Not always. I shouldn't like a train. I should
like to get into a boat with silver sails, and sail
straight down a singing river into the heart of the
sunset."</p>

<p>"Well, of course, you couldn't," said the plump
and practical Peggy, "but it sounds nice to say it.
Does our river sing, Miss Anne?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What does it say?"</p>

<p>Anne stretched out her arms with a little yearning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>[<a href="./images/222.png">222</a>]</span>
gesture. "It says&mdash;'<i>Come and see the world, see
the world, see the world!</i>'"</p>

<p>"It never says that to me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you haven't ears to hear, Peggy."</p>

<p>It was a very charming wedding. Richard was
there and Nancy, and David and Brinsley. The
country folk came from far and wide, and there was
a brave showing of Old Gentlemen from Bower's who
brought generous gifts for Peter's pretty daughter.</p>

<p>Richard, standing back of his mother during the
ceremony, could see over her head to where Anne
waited not far from Peggy to prompt her in her
bridesmaid's duties. She was in white. Her dark
hair was swept up in the fashion which she had borrowed
from Eve. She seemed very small and slight
against the background of Bower's buxom kinsfolk.</p>

<p>As he caught her eye he smiled at her, but she did
not smile back. She felt that she could not. How
could he smile with that little mother drooping before
his very eyes? How <i>could</i> he?</p>

<p>She found herself later, when the refreshments
were served, brooding over Nancy. The little lady
tasted nothing, but was not permitted to refuse the
cup of tea which Anne brought to her.</p>

<p>"I had it made especially for you," she said;
"you looked so tired."</p>

<p>"I am tired. You see we are having rather strenuous
days."</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>[<a href="./images/223.png">223</a>]</span>
"It isn't easy to let&mdash;him&mdash;go."</p>

<p>"It isn't easy for anybody to let him go."</p>

<p>The eyes of the two women went to where Richard
in the midst of a protesting group was trying to
explain his reasons for deserting Crossroads.</p>

<p>He couldn't explain. They had a feeling that he
was turning his back on them. "It's hard lines to
have a good doctor and then lose him," was the general
sentiment. He was made to feel that it would
have been better not to have come than to end by
deserting.</p>

<p>He was aware that he had forfeited something
precious, and he voiced his thought when he joined
his mother and Anne.</p>

<p>"I'll never have a practice quite like this. Neighborhood
ties are something they know little about in
cities."</p>

<p>His mother smiled up at him bravely. "There'll
be other things."</p>

<p>"Perhaps;" he patted her hand. Then he fired a
question at Anne. "Do you think I ought to go?"</p>

<p>"How can I tell?" Her eyes met his candidly.
"I felt when you came that I couldn't understand
how a man could bury himself here. And now I am
wondering how you can leave. It seems as if you
belong."</p>

<p>"I know what you mean."</p>

<p>She went on: "And I can't quite think of this
dear lady alone."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>[<a href="./images/224.png">224</a>]</span>
Nancy stopped her. "Don't speak of that, my
dear. I don't want you to speak of it. It is right
that Richard should go."</p>

<p>Anne was telling herself passionately that it was
not right, when Beulah sent for her, and presently
the little bride came down in her going-away gown,
to be joined by Eric in the stiff clothes which seemed
to rob him of the picturesqueness which belonged to
him in less formal moments.</p>

<p>But Richard had no eyes for the bride and groom;
he saw only Anne at the head of the stairway where
he had first talked to her. How long ago it seemed,
and how sweet she had been, and how shy.</p>

<p>The train was on the bridge, and a laughing
crowd hurried out into the night to meet it. Peggy
in the lead threw roses with a prodigal hand. "Kiss
me, Beulah," she begged at the last.</p>

<p>Beulah bent down to her, then was lifted in Eric's
strong arms to the platform. Then the train drew
out and she was gone!</p>

<p>Alone on the stairway, Anne and Richard had a
moment before the crowd swept back upon them.</p>

<p>"Dr. Brooks, take your mother with you."</p>

<p>"She won't go."</p>

<p>"Then stay with her."</p>

<p>He caught at the edge of her flowing sleeve, and
held it as if he would anchor her to him. "Do you
want me to stay?"</p>

<p>Her eyes came up to him. She saw in them some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>[<a href="./images/225.png">225</a>]</span>thing
which lifted her above and beyond her doubts
of him. She had an ineffable sense of having found
something which she could never lose.</p>

<p>Then as he drew back he was stammering, "Forgive
me. I have been wanting to wish you happiness.
Geoffrey told me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And now Peggy bore down upon them and all
the heedless happy crowd, and Richard said, "Good-night,"
and was gone.</p>

<p>Yet when she was left alone, Anne felt desperately
that she should have shouted after him, "I am not
going to marry Geoffrey Fox. I am not going to
be married at all."</p>

<h3><i>In Which Anne Asks and Jimmie Answers.</i></h3>


<p>"'<span class="smcap">A moneyless</span> man,'" said Uncle Rod,
"'goes quickly through the market.'"</p>

<p>He had a basket on his arm. Anne, who was at
her easel, looked up. "What did you buy?"</p>

<p>He laughed. His laugh had in it a quality of youth
which seemed to contradict the signs of age which
were upon him. Yet even these signs were modified
by the carefulness of his attire and the distinction
of his carriage. Great-uncle Rodman had been a
dandy in his day, and even now his Norfolk coat
and knickerbockers, his long divided beard and
flowing tie gave him an air half foreign, wholly his
own.</p>

<p>In his basket was a melon, crusty rolls, peaches
and a bottle of cream.</p>

<p>"Such extravagance!" Anne said, as he showed
her the bottle.</p>

<p>"It was the price of two chops. And not a lamb
the less for it. Two chops would have been an extravagance,
and now we shall feast innocently and
economically."</p>

<p>"Where shall we eat?" Anne asked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>[<a href="./images/227.png">227</a>]</span>
"Under the oak?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Too sunny."</p>

<p>"In the garden?"</p>

<p>"Not till to-night&mdash;people can see us from the
road."</p>

<p>"You choose then." It was a game that they
had played ever since she had come to him. It
gave to each meal the atmosphere of an adventure.</p>

<p>"I choose," she clapped her hands, "I choose&mdash;by
the fish-pond, Uncle Rod."</p>

<p>The fish-pond was at the end of the garden walk.
Just beyond it a wooden gate connected a high
brick wall and opened upon an acre or two of pasture
where certain cows browsed luxuriously. The
brick wall and the cows and the quiet of the corner
made the fish-pond seem miles away from the town
street which was faced by the front of Cousin Margaret's
house.</p>

<p>The fish-pond was a favorite choice in the game
played by Anne and Uncle Rod. But they did not
always choose it because that would have made it
commonplace and would have robbed it of its
charm.</p>

<p>Anne, rising to arrange the tray, was stopped by
Uncle Rodman. "Sit still, my dear; I'll get things
ready."</p>

<p>To see him at his housekeeping was a pleasant
sight. He liked it, and gave to it his whole mind.
The peeling of the peaches with a silver knife, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a>[<a href="./images/228.png">228</a>]</span>
selection of a bowl of old English ware to put them
in, and making of the coffee in a copper machine,
the fresh linen, the roses as a last perfect touch.</p>

<p>Anne carried the tray, for his weak arm could not
be depended upon; and by the fish-pond they ate
their simple meal.</p>

<p>The old fishes had crumbs and came to the top of
the water to get them, and a cow looking over the
gate was rewarded by the remaining half of the
crusty roll. She walked away presently to give
place to a slender youth who had crossed the fields
and now stood with his hat off looking in.</p>

<p>"If it isn't Anne," he said, "and Uncle Rod."</p>

<p>Uncle Rod stood up. He did not smile and he
did not ask the slender youth to enter. But Anne
was more hospitable.</p>

<p>"Come in, Jimmie," she said. "I can't offer you
any lunch because we have eaten it all up. But
there's some coffee."</p>

<p>Jimmie entered with alacrity. He had come back
from New York in a mood of great discontent, to
meet the pleasant news that Anne Warfield was in
town. He had flown at once to find her. If he had
expected the Fatted Calf, he found none. Uncle
Rodman left them at once. He had a certain
amount of philosophy, but it had never taught him
patience with Jimmie Ford.</p>

<p>Jimmie drank a cup of coffee, and talked of his
summer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>[<a href="./images/229.png">229</a>]</span>
"Saw your Dr. Richard in New York, out at
Austin's."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"He's going to marry Eve."</p>

<p>"Is he?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I don't understand what she sees in him&mdash;he
isn't good style."</p>

<p>"He doesn't have to be."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Men like Richard Brooks mean more to the
world than just&mdash;clothes, Jimmie."</p>

<p>"I don't see it."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I?"</p>

<p>"Well, you look so nice in your clothes&mdash;and you
need them to look nice in."</p>

<p>He stared at her. He felt dimly that she was
making fun of him.</p>

<p>"From the way you put it," he said, with irritation,
"from the way you put it any one might think
that it was just my clothes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That make you attractive? Oh, <i>no</i>, Jimmie.
You have nice eyes and&mdash;and a way with you."</p>

<p>She was sewing on a scrap of fancy work, and
her own eyes were on it. She was as demure as
possible, but she seemed unusually and disconcertingly
self-possessed.</p>

<p>And now Jimmie became plaintive. Plaintiveness
had always been his strong suit with Anne. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>[<a href="./images/230.png">230</a>]</span>
was eager for sympathy. His affair with Eve had
hurt his vanity.</p>

<p>"I have never seen a girl like her. She doesn't
care what the world thinks. She doesn't care what
any one thinks. She goes right along taking
everything that comes her way&mdash;and giving nothing."</p>

<p>"Did you want her to give you&mdash;anything,
Jimmie?"</p>

<p>"Me? Not me. She's a beauty and all that.
But I wouldn't marry her if she were as rich as
Rockefeller&mdash;and she isn't. Her money is her Aunt
Maude's."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jimmie&mdash;sour grapes."</p>

<p>"Sour nothing. She isn't my kind. She said
one day that if she wanted a man she'd ask him to
marry her. That it was a woman's right to choose.
I can't stand that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"But if she should ask you, Jimmie?"</p>

<p>Again he stared at her. "I jolly well shouldn't
give her a chance. Not after the way she treated
me."</p>

<p>"What way?"</p>

<p>"Oh, making me think I was the whole thing&mdash;and
then&mdash;throwing me down."</p>

<p>"Oh, so you don't like being thrown down?"</p>

<p>"No. I don't like that kind of a woman. You
know the kind of woman I like, Anne."</p>

<p>The caressing note in his voice came to her like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>[<a href="./images/231.png">231</a>]</span>
an echo of other days. But now it had no power to
move her.</p>

<p>"I am not sure that I do know the kind of woman
you like&mdash;tell me."</p>

<p>"Oh, I like a woman that is a woman, and makes
a man feel that he's the whole thing."</p>

<p>"But mustn't he be the whole thing to make her
feel that he is?"</p>

<p>He flung himself out of his chair and stood before
her. "Anne," he demanded, "can't you do anything
but ask questions? You aren't a bit like you
used to be."</p>

<p>She laid down her work and now he could see her
eyes. Such steady eyes! "No, I'm not like myself.
You see, Jimmie, I have been away for a year,
and one learns such a lot in a year."</p>

<p>He felt a sudden sense of loss. There had always
been the old Anne to come back to. The Anne who
had believed and had sympathized. Again his voice
took on a plaintive note. "Be good to me, girl,"
he said. Then very low, "Anne, I was half afraid
to come to-day."</p>

<p>"Afraid&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose you think I acted like a&mdash;cad."</p>

<p>"What do <i>you</i> think?"</p>

<p>"Oh, stop asking questions. It was the only
thing to do. You were poor and I was poor, and
there wasn't anything ahead of me&mdash;or of you&mdash;surely
you can't blame me."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>[<a href="./images/232.png">232</a>]</span>
"How can I blame you for what was, after all, my
great good fortune?"</p>

<p>"Your what?"</p>

<p>She said it again, quietly, "My great good
fortune, Jimmie. I couldn't see it then. Indeed, I
was very unhappy and sentimental and cynical over
it. But now I know what life can hold for me&mdash;and
what it would not have held if I had married
you."</p>

<p>"Anne, who has been making love to you?"</p>

<p>"Jimmie!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no woman ever talks like that until she has
found somebody else. And I thought you were
constant."</p>

<p>"Constant to what?"</p>

<p>"To the thought&mdash;to&mdash;to the thought of what we
might be to each other some day."</p>

<p>"And in the meantime you were asking Eve to
marry you. Was it her money that you wanted?"</p>

<p>"Her money! Do you think I am a fortune-hunter?"</p>

<p>"I am asking you, Jimmie?"</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, stop asking questions. You
know how a pretty woman goes to my head. And
she's the kind that flits away to make you follow.
I can't fancy your doing that sort of a thing,
Anne."</p>

<p>"No," quietly, "women like myself, Jimmie, go
on expecting that things will come to them&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>[<a href="./images/233.png">233</a>]</span>
when they don't come, we keep on&mdash;expecting. But
somehow we never seem to be able to reach out our
hands to take&mdash;what we might have."</p>

<p>He began to feel better. This was the wistful
Anne of the old days.</p>

<p>"There has never been any one like you, Anne.
It seems good to be here. Women like Eve madden
a man, but your kind are so&mdash;comfortable."</p>

<p>Always the old Jimmie! Wanting his ease!
After he had left her she sat looking out over the
gate beyond the fields to the gold of the west.</p>

<p>When at last she went up to the house Uncle Rod
had had his nap and was in his big chair on the front
porch.</p>

<p>"Jimmie and I are friends again," she told him.</p>

<p>He looked at her inquiringly. "Real friends?"</p>

<p>"Surface friends. He is coming again to tell me
his troubles and get my sympathy. Uncle Rod,
what makes me so clear-eyed all of a sudden?"</p>

<p>He smoothed his beard. "My dear, 'the eyes of
the hare are one thing, the eyes of the owl another.'
You are looking at life from a different point of view.
I knew that if you ever met a real man you'd know
the difference between him and Jimmie Ford."</p>

<p>She came over, and standing behind him, put her
hands on his shoulders. "I've found him, Uncle
Rod."</p>

<p>"St. Michael?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>[<a href="./images/234.png">234</a>]</span>
"Poor little girl."</p>

<p>"I am not poor, Uncle Rod. I am rich. It is
enough to have known him."</p>

<p>The sunset was showing above the wooden gate.
The cows had gone home. The old fish swam
lazily in the shadowed water.</p>

<p>Anne drew her low chair to the old man's side.
"Uncle Rod, isn't it queer, the difference between the
things we ask for and the things we get? To have
a dream come true doesn't mean always that you
must get what you want, does it? For sometimes
you get something that is more wonderful than any
dream. And now if you'll listen, and not look at
me, I'll tell you all about it, you darling dear."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It was in late August that Anne received the first
proof sheets of Geoffrey's book. "I want you to
read it before any one else. It will be dedicated to
you and it is better than I dared believe&mdash;I could
never have written it without your help, your inspiration."</p>

<p>It was a great book. Anne, remembering the
moment the plot had been conceived on that quiet
night by Peggy's bedside when she had seen the
pussy cat and had heard the tinkling bell, laid it
down with a feeling almost of awe.</p>

<p>She wrote Geoffrey about it. It was her first real
letter to him. She had written one little note of forgiveness
and of friendliness, but she had felt that for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a>[<a href="./images/235.png">235</a>]</span>
a time at least she should do no more than that,
and Uncle Rod had commended her resolution.</p>

<p>"Hot fires had best burn out," he said.</p>

<p>"If you never do anything else," Anne wrote to
Geoffrey, "you can be content. There isn't a line
of pot-boiling in it. It is as if you had dipped your
pen in magic ink. Rereading it to Uncle Rodman
has brought back the nights when we talked it over,
and I can't help feeling a little peacock-y to know
that I had a part in it.</p>

<p>"And now I am going to tell you what Uncle
Rod's comment was when I finished the very last
word. He sat as still as a solemn old statue, and
then he said, 'Geoffrey Fox is a great man. No one
could have written like that who was sordid of mind
or small of soul.'</p>

<p>"If you knew my Uncle Rodman you would
understand all that his opinion stands for. He is
never flattering, but he has had much time to think&mdash;he
is like one of the old prophets&mdash;so that, indeed, I
sometimes feel that he ought to sing his sentences
like David, instead of saying wise things in an
ordinary way. And his proverbs! he has such a
collection, he is making a book of them, and he digs
into old volumes in all sorts of languages&mdash;oh, some
day you must know him!</p>

<p>"I am going back to Crossroads. It seems that
my work lies there. And I have great news for you.
I am to live with Mrs. Brooks. She has her cousin,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>[<a href="./images/236.png">236</a>]</span>
Sulie Tyson, with her, but she wants me. And it
will be so much better than Bower's.</p>

<p>"All through Mrs. Nancy's letters I can read her
loneliness. She tries to keep it out. But she can't.
She is proud of her son's success&mdash;but she feels the
separation intensely. He has his work, she only
her thoughts of him&mdash;and that's the tragedy.</p>

<p>"In the meantime, here we are at Cousin Margaret's
doing funny little stunts in the way of cooking
and catering. We can't afford the kind of
housekeeping which requires servants, so it is a case
of plain living and high thinking. Uncle Rod hates
to eat anything that has been killed, and makes all
sorts of excuses not to. He won't call himself a
vegetarian, for he thinks that people who label
themselves are apt to be cranks. So he does our
bit of marketing and comes home triumphant with
his basket innocent of birds or beasts, and we live
on ambrosia and nectar or the modern equivalent.
We are quite classic with our feasts by the old fish-pond
at the end of the garden.</p>

<p>"Cousin Margaret's garden is flaming in the
August days with phlox, and is fragrant with day
lilies. There's a grass walk and a sun-dial, and best
of all, as I have said, the fish-pond.</p>

<p>"And while I am on the subject of gardens, Uncle
Rod rises up in wrath when people insist upon giving
the botanical names to all of our lovely blooms.
He says that the pedants are taking all of the poetry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>[<a href="./images/237.png">237</a>]</span>
out of language, and it does seem so, doesn't it?
Why should we call larkspur <i>Delphinium</i>? or a forget-me-not
<i>Myostis Palustria</i>, and would a primrose
by the river's brim ever be to you or to me <i>primula
vulgaris</i>? Uncle Rod says that a rose by any other
name would <i>not</i> smell as sweet; and it is fortunate
that the worst the botanists may do cannot spoil the
generic&mdash;<i>rosa</i>.</p>

<p>"And now with my talk of Uncle Rod and of Me,
I am stringing this letter far beyond all limits, and
yet I have not told you half the news.</p>

<p>"I had a little note from Beulah, and she and
Eric are at home in the Playhouse. She loves your
silver candlesticks. So many of her presents were
practical and she prefers the 'pretties.'</p>

<p>"You have heard, of course, that Dr. Brooks is to
marry Eve Chesley. The wedding will not take
place for some time. I wonder if they will live with
Aunt Maude. I can't quite imagine Dr. Richard's
wings clipped to such a cage."</p>

<p>She signed herself, "Always your friend, Anne
Warfield."</p>

<p>Far up in the Northern woods Geoffrey read her
letter. He could use his eyes a little, but most of
the time he lay with them shut and Mimi read to
him, or wrote for him at his dictation. He had
grown to be very dependent on Mimi; there were
even times when he had waked in the night, groping
and calling out, and she had gathered him in her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>[<a href="./images/238.png">238</a>]</span>
arms and had held him against her breast until he
stopped shaking and shivering and saying that he
could not see.</p>

<p>He spoke her name now, and she came to him.
He put Anne's letter in her hand. "Read it!" and
when she had read, he said, "You see she says that
I am great&mdash;and she used to say it. Am I, Mimi?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Geoffrey, yes."</p>

<p>"I want you to make it true, Mimi. Shall I begin
my new book to-morrow?"</p>

<p>It was what she had wanted, what she had begged
that he would do, but he had refused to listen. And
now he was listening to another voice!</p>

<p>She brought her note-book, and sat beside him.
Being ignorant of shorthand she had invented a
little system of her own, and she was glad when she
could make him laugh over her funny pot-hooks and
her straggling sketches.</p>

<p>Thus in the darkness Geoffrey struggled and
strove. "Speaking of candlesticks," he wrote to
Anne, "it was as if a thousand candles lighted my
world when I read your letter!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3><i>In Which Pan Pipes to the Stars.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">That</span> Richard in New York should miss his
mother was inevitable. But he was not homesick.
He was too busy for that. Austin's vogue
was tremendous.</p>

<p>"Every successful man ought to be two men," he
told Richard, as they talked together one Sunday
night at Austin's place in Westchester, "'another
and himself,' as Browning puts it. Then there
would be one to labor and the other to enjoy. I
want to retire, and I can't. There's a selfish instinct
in all of us to grip and hold. That is why I am
pinning my faith to you. You can slip in as I slip
out. I have visions of riding to hounds and sailing
the seas some day, to say nothing of putting up a
good game of golf. But perhaps that's a dream. A
man can't get away from his work, not when he
loves it."</p>

<p>"That's why you're such a success, sir," Richard
told him, honestly; "you go to every operation as if
it were a banquet."</p>

<p>Austin laughed. "I'm not such a ghoul. But
there's always the wonder of it with me. I some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>[<a href="./images/240.png">240</a>]</span>times
wish I had been a churchgoing man, Brooks.
There isn't much more for me to learn about bodies,
but there's much about souls. I have a feeling that
some day in some physical experiment I shall find
tangible evidence of the spiritual. That's why I say
my prayers to Something every night, and I rather
think It's God."</p>

<p>"I know it's God," said Richard, simply, "on
such a night as this."</p>

<p>They were silent in the face of the evening's
beauty. The great trees on the old estate were
black against a silver sky. White statues shone
like pale ghosts among them. Back of Richard
and his host, in a semicircle of dark cedars, a marble
Pan piped to the stars.</p>

<p>"And in the cities babies are sleeping on fire
escapes," Austin meditated. "If I had had a son
I should have sent him to the slums to find his
work. But the Fates have given me only Marie-Louise."</p>

<p>And now his laugh was forced. "Brooks, the
Gods have checkmated me. Marie-Louise is the
son of her father. I had planned that she should be
the daughter of her mother. I sowed some rather
wild oats in my youth, and waked in middle age to
the knowledge that my materialism had led me
astray. So I married an idealist. I wanted my
children to have a spiritual background of character
such as I have not possessed. And the result of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>[<a href="./images/241.png">241</a>]</span>
that marriage is&mdash;Marie-Louise! If she has a soul
it is yet to be discovered."</p>

<p>"She is young. Give her time."</p>

<p>"I have been giving her time for eighteen years.
I have wanted to see her mother in her, to see some
gleam of that exquisite fineness. There are things
we men, the most material of us, want in our
women, and I want it in Marie-Louise. But she
gives back what I have given her&mdash;nothing more.
And I don't know what to do with her."</p>

<p>"Her mother?" Richard hinted.</p>

<p>"Julie is worn out with trying to meet a nature so
unlike her own. Our love for each other has made
us understand. But neither of us understands
Marie-Louise. I sent her away to school, but she
wouldn't stay. She likes her home and she hates
rules. She loves animals, and if she were a boy she
would practice medicine. Being a woman and having
no outlet for her energies, she is freakish. You
saw the way she was dressed at dinner."</p>

<p>"I liked it," Richard said; "all that dead silver
with her red hair."</p>

<p>"But it is too&mdash;sophisticated, for a young girl.
Why, man, she ought to be in white frocks and
pearls, and putting cushions behind her mother's
back."</p>

<p>"You say that because her mother wore white and
pearls, and put cushions behind <i>her</i> mother's back.
There aren't many of the white-frocks-and-pearls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a>[<a href="./images/242.png">242</a>]</span>
kind left. It's a new generation. Perhaps dead
silver with red hair is an expression of it. And it is
we who don't understand."</p>

<p>"Perhaps. But it's a problem." Austin rose. "If
you'll excuse me, Brooks, I'll go to my wife. We
always read together on Sunday nights."</p>

<p>He sent Marie-Louise out to Richard. She came
through the starlight, a shining figure in her silver
dress, with a silver Persian kitten hugged up in her
arms. She sat on the sun-dial and swung her jade
bracelet for the kitten to play with.</p>

<p>"Dad and mother are reading the Bible. He
doesn't believe in it, and she gets him to listen once
a week. And then she reads the prayers for the
day. When I was a little girl I had to listen&mdash;but
never again!"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Why should I listen to things that I don't believe?
To-night it is the ten virgins and their
lamps. And Dad's pretending that he's interested.
I am writing a play about it, but mother doesn't
know. The Wise Virgins are Bernard Shaw women
who know what they want in the way of husbands
and go to it. The Foolish Virgins are the old
maids, who think it unwomanly to get ready, and
find themselves left in the end!"</p>

<p>The silver kitten clawed at the silver dress, and
climbed on her mistress's shoulder.</p>

<p>"All of the parables make good modern plots.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a>[<a href="./images/243.png">243</a>]</span>
Mother would be shocked if she knew I was writing
them that way. So I don't tell her. Mother is a
dear, but she doesn't understand. I should like to
tell things to Dad, but he won't listen. If I were a
boy he would listen. But he thinks I ought to be
like mother."</p>

<p>She slipped from the sun-dial and came and sat
in the chair which her father had vacated. "If I
were a boy I should have studied medicine. I
wanted to be a trained nurse, but Dad wouldn't let
me. He said I'd hate having to do the hard work,
and perhaps I should. I like to wear pretty clothes,
and a nurse never has a chance."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'll marry."</p>

<p>"Oh, no. I should <i>hate</i> to be like mother."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"She just lives for Dad. Now I couldn't do that.
I am not going to marry. I don't like men. They
ask too much. I like books and cats and being by
myself. I am never lonesome. Sometimes I talk
to Pan over there, and pretend he is playing to me
on his pipes, and then I write poetry. Real poetry.
I'll read it to you some time. There's one called
'The Rose Garden.' I wrote it about a woman who
was a patient of father's. When she knew she
was going to die she wrote him a little note and
asked him to see that her body was cremated, and
that the ashes were strewn over the roses in his
garden. He didn't seem to see anything in it but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>[<a href="./images/244.png">244</a>]</span>
just a sick woman's fancy. But I knew that she
was in love with him. And my poem tells that
her blessed dust gathered itself into a gentle wraith
which lives and breathes near him."</p>

<p>"And you aren't afraid to feel that her gentle
wraith is here in the garden?"</p>

<p>"Why should I be? I don't believe in ghosts.
I don't believe in fairies, either, or Santa Claus.
But I like to read about them and write about them,
and&mdash;and wish that it might be so."</p>

<p>There was something almost wistful in her voice.
Richard, aware suddenly of what a child she was,
bent forward.</p>

<p>"I think I half believe in fairies, and Christmas
wouldn't be anything without Santa Claus, and as
for the soul of your gentle lady, I have a feeling
that it is finding Heaven in the rose garden."</p>

<p>She was stroking the silver kitten which had
curled up in her lap. "I wish I weren't such a&mdash;heathen,"
she said, suddenly. "I know what you
mean. But it is only the poetic sense in me that
makes me know. I can't <i>believe</i> anything. Not
about souls&mdash;or prayers. Do you ever pray?"</p>

<p>"Every night. On my knees."</p>

<p>"On your knees? Oh, is it as bad as that?"</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Richard, writing to his mother, said of Marie-Louise,
"Her mind isn't in a healthy state. It
hasn't anything to feed on. Her father is too busy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a>[<a href="./images/245.png">245</a>]</span>
and her mother too ill to realize that she needs companionship
of a certain kind. I wish she might have
been a pupil at the Crossroads school, with Anne
Warfield for her teacher. But no hope of that."</p>

<p>He wrote, too, of his rushing days, and Nancy,
answering, hid from him the utter hopelessness of
her outlook. Her life began and ended with his
letters and the week-ends which he was able to give
her. But some of his week-ends had to be spent
with Eve; a man cannot completely ignore the fact
that he has a fianc&eacute;e, and Richard would have been
less than human if he had not responded to the
appeal of youth and beauty. So he motored with
Eve and danced with Eve, and did all of the delightful
summer things which are possible in the
big city near the sea. Aunt Maude went to the
North Shore, but Eve stayed with Winifred, and
wove about Richard her spells of flattery and of
frivolity.</p>

<p>"I want to be near you, Dicky boy. If I'm not
you'll work too hard."</p>

<p>"It is work that I like."</p>

<p>"I believe that you like it better than you do me,
Dicky."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly, Eve."</p>

<p>"You are always saying that. Do you like your
work better than you do me, Dicky?"</p>

<p>"Of course not." But he had no pretty things to
say.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a>[<a href="./images/246.png">246</a>]</span>
The life that he lived with her, however, and with
Pip and Winifred and Tony was a heady wine
which swept away regrets. He had no time to
think. He worked by day and played by night, and
often after their play there was work again. Now
and then, as the Sunday night when he had first
met Marie-Louise, he motored with Austin out to
Westchester. Mrs. Austin spent her summers there.
Long journeys tired her, and she would not leave
her husband. Marie-Louise stayed at "Rose Acres"
because she hated big hotels, and found cottage
colonies stupid. The great gardens swept down to
the river&mdash;the wide, blue river with the high bluffs
on the sunset side.</p>

<p>The river at Bower's was not blue; it showed in
the spring the red of the clay which was washed
into it, and now and then a clear green when the
rains held off, but it was rarely blue except on certain
sapphire days in the fall, when a northwest wind
swept all clouds from the sky.</p>

<p>And this was not a singing river. It was too
near the sea, and too full of boats, and there was no
reason why it should say, "<i>Come and see&mdash;come and
see&mdash;the world</i>," when the world was at its feet!</p>

<p>And so the great Hudson had no song for Richard.
Yet now and then, as he walked down to it
in the warm darkness, his ears seemed to catch a
faint echo of the harmonies which had filled his soul
on the day that Anne Warfield had dried her hair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a>[<a href="./images/247.png">247</a>]</span>
on the bank of the old river at Bower's, and had
walked with him in the wood.</p>

<p>Except at such moments, however, it must be confessed
that he thought little of Anne Warfield. It
hurt to think of her. And he was too much of a
surgeon to want to turn the knife in the wound.</p>

<p>Marie-Louise, developing a keen interest in his
affairs as they grew better acquainted, questioned
him about Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Dad says you are going to marry her."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Is she pretty?"</p>

<p>"Rather more than that."</p>

<p>"Why don't you bring her out?"</p>

<p>"Nobody asked me, sir, she said."</p>

<p>She flashed a smile at him.</p>

<p>"I like your nursery-rhyme way of talking. You
are the humanest thing that we have ever had in
this house. Mother is a harp of a thousand strings,
and Dad is a dynamo. But you are flesh and
blood."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>"I wish you'd ask your Evelyn out here, and her
friends. For tea and tennis some Saturday afternoon.
I want to see you together."</p>

<p>But after she had seen them together, she said,
shrewdly, "You are not in love with her."</p>

<p>"I am going to marry her, child. Isn't that proof
enough?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a>[<a href="./images/248.png">248</a>]</span>
"It isn't any proof at all. The big man is the one
who really cares."</p>

<p>"The big man? Pip?"</p>

<p>"Is that what you call him? He looks at her like
a dog waiting for a bone. And he brightens when
she speaks to him. And her eyes are always on you
and yours are never on her."</p>

<p>"Marie-Louise, you are an uncanny creature.
Like your little silver cat. She watches mice and
you watch me. I have a feeling that you are going
to pounce on me."</p>

<p>"Some day I shall pounce," she poked her finger
at him, "and shake you as my little cat shakes a
mouse, and you'll wake up."</p>

<p>"Am I asleep, Marie-Louise?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You haven't heard Pan pipe." She was
leaning on the sun-dial and looking up at the grinning
god. "Men who live in cities have no ears to hear."</p>

<p>"Are you a thousand years old, Marie-Louise?"</p>

<p>"I am as old as the centuries," she told him
gravely. "I played with Pan when the world was
young."</p>

<p>They smiled at each other, and then he said, "My
mother wants me to live in the country. Do you
think if I were there I should hear Pan pipe?"</p>

<p>"Not if you were there because your mother wished
it. It is only when you love it yourself that the river
calls and you hear the fluting of the wind in the
rushes."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a>[<a href="./images/249.png">249</a>]</span>
It was an August Saturday, hot and humid.
Marie-Louise was in thin white, but it was a white
with a difference from the demure summer frocks of
a former generation. The modern note was in the
white fur which came high up about Marie-Louise's
throat. Yet she did not look warm. Her skin was
as pale as the pearls in her ears. Her red hair
flamed, but without warmth; it rippled back from
her forehead to a cool and classic coil.</p>

<p>"If you marry your Eve," she told Richard, "and
stay with father, you'll grow rich and fat, and forget
the state of your soul."</p>

<p>"I thought you didn't believe in souls."</p>

<p>She flushed faintly. "I believe in yours. But
your Eve doesn't. She likes you because you don't
care, and everybody else does. And that isn't love."</p>

<p>"What is love?"</p>

<p>She pondered. "I don't know. I've never felt
it. And I don't want to feel it. If I loved too much
I should die&mdash;and if I didn't love enough I should
be ashamed."</p>

<p>"You are a queer child, Marie-Louise."</p>

<p>"I am not a child. Dad thinks I am, and mother.
But they don't know."</p>

<p>There were day lilies growing about the sun-dial.
She gathered a handful of white blooms and laid
them at the feet of the piping Pan. "I shall write a
poem about it," she said, "of a girl who loved a
marble god, and who found it&mdash;enough. Every day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>[<a href="./images/250.png">250</a>]</span>
she laid a flower at his feet. And a human came to
woo her, and she told him, 'If I loved you, you
would ask more of me than my marble lover. He
asks only that I lay flowers at his feet.'"</p>

<p>He could never be sure whether she was in jest or
earnest. And now she narrowed her eyes in a quizzical
smile and was gone.</p>

<p>He spoke of Marie-Louise to Eve. "She hasn't
enough to do. She ought to be busy with her fancy
work and her household matters."</p>

<p>"No woman is busy with household matters in
this age, Dicky. Nor with fancy work. Is that
what you expect of a wife?"</p>

<p>He didn't know what he expected, and he told her
so. But he knew he was expecting more than she
was prepared to give. Eve had an off-with-the-old-and-on-with-the-new
theory of living which left him
breathless. She expressed it one night when she
said that she shouldn't have "obey" in her marriage
service. "I never expect to mind you, Dicky, so
what's the use?"</p>

<p>There was no use, of course. Yet he had a feeling
that he was being robbed of something sweet and
sacred. The quaint old service asked things of men as
well as of women. Good and loving and fine things.
He was old-fashioned enough to want to promise all
that it asked, and to have his wife promise.</p>

<p>Eve laughed, too, at Richard's grace before meat.
"You mustn't embarrass me at formal dinners,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>[<a href="./images/251.png">251</a>]</span>
Dicky. Somehow it won't seem quite in keeping
with the cocktails, will it?"</p>

<p>Thus the spirit of Eve, contending with all that
made him the son of his mother, meeting his
spiritual revolts with material arguments, banking
the fires of his flaming aspirations!</p>

<p>Yet he rarely let himself dwell upon this aspect
of it. He had set his feet in a certain path, and he
was prepared to follow it.</p>

<p>On this path, at every turning, he met Philip.
The big man had not been driven from the field by
the fact of Eve's engagement. He still asked her to
go with him, he still planned pleasures for her. His
money made things easy, and while he included
Richard in most of his plans, he looked upon him as
a necessary evil. Eve refused to go without her
young doctor.</p>

<p>Now and then, however, he had her alone.
"Dicky's called to an appendicitis case," she informed
him ruefully, one night over the telephone,
"and I am dead lonesome. Come and cheer me
up."</p>

<p>He went to her, and during the evening proposed
a week-end yachting trip which should take them to
the North Shore and Aunt Maude.</p>

<p>"Is Dicky invited?"</p>

<p>"Of course. But I'm not sure that I want him."</p>

<p>"He wouldn't come if he knew that you felt like
that."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>[<a href="./images/252.png">252</a>]</span>
"It isn't anything personal. And you know my
manner is perfect when I'm with him."</p>

<p>"Yes. Poor Dicky. Pip, we are a pair of deceivers.
I sometimes think I ought to tell him."</p>

<p>"There's nothing to tell."</p>

<p>"Nothing tangible,&mdash;but he's so straightforward.
And he'd hate the idea that I'm letting you&mdash;make
love to me."</p>

<p>"I don't make love. I have never touched the
tip of your finger."</p>

<p>"<i>Pip!</i> Of course not. But your eyes make love,
and your manner&mdash;and deep down in my heart I am
afraid."</p>

<p>"Afraid of what?"</p>

<p>"That Fate isn't going to give me what I want.
I don't want you, Pip. I want Dicky. And if you
loved me&mdash;you'd let me alone."</p>

<p>"Tell me to go,&mdash;and I won't come back."</p>

<p>"Not ever?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>She weakened. "But I don't want you to go
away. You see, you are my good friend, Pip."</p>

<p>She should not have let him stay. She knew
that. She found it necessary to apologize to Richard.
"You see, Pip cares an awful lot."</p>

<p>Richard had little sympathy. "He might as well
take his medicine and not hang around you, Eve."</p>

<p>"If you would hang around a little more perhaps
he wouldn't."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a>[<a href="./images/253.png">253</a>]</span>
"I am very busy. You know that."</p>

<p>His voice was stern. "If I am a busy husband,
will you make that an excuse for having Pip at
your heels?"</p>

<p>"<i>Richard.</i>"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon. I shouldn't have said that.
But marriage to me means more than good times.
Life means more than good times. When I am here
in New York it seems to me sometimes that I am
drugged by work and pleasure. That there isn't a
moment in which to live in a leisurely thoughtful
sense."</p>

<p>"You should have stayed at Crossroads."</p>

<p>"I can't go back. I have burned my bridges.
Austin expects things of me, and I must live up to
his expectations. And, besides, I like it."</p>

<p>"Really, Dicky?"</p>

<p>"Really. There's a stimulus about the rush of it
and the big things we are doing. Austin is a giant.
My association with him is the biggest thing that
has ever come into my life."</p>

<p>"Bigger than your love for me?"</p>

<p>Thus she brought him back to it. Making always
demands upon him which he could not meet. He
found himself harassed by her continued harping on
the personal point of view, yet there were moments
when she swung him into step with her. And one
of the moments came when she spoke of the yachting
trip. It was very hot, and Richard loved the sea.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>[<a href="./images/254.png">254</a>]</span>
"Dicky, I'll keep Pip in the background if you I
promise to come."</p>

<p>"How can you keep him in the background when
he is our host?"</p>

<p>"He is going to invite Marie-Louise. And he'll
have to be nice to her. And you and I&mdash;&mdash;!
Dicky, we'll feel the slap of the breeze in our faces,
and forget that there's a big city back of us with
sick people in it, and slums and hot nights. Dicky&mdash;I
love you&mdash;and I am going to be your wife.
Won't you come&mdash;because I want you&mdash;<i>Dicky</i>?"</p>

<p>There were tears on her cheeks as she made her
plea, and he was always moved by her tears. It
was his protective sense that had first tied him to
her; it was still through his chivalry that she made
her most potent appeal.</p>

<p>Marie-Louise was glad to go. "It will be like
watching a play."</p>

<p>She and Richard were waiting for Pip's "Mermaid"
to make a landing at the pier at Rose Acres.
A man-servant with their bags stood near, and
Marie-Louise's maid was coated and hatted to accompany
her mistress. "It will be like watching a
play," Marie-Louise repeated. "The eternal trio.
Two men and a girl."</p>

<p>She waved to the quartette on the forward deck.
"Your big man looks fine in his yachting things.
And your Eve is nice in white."</p>

<p>Marie-Louise was not in white. In spite of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a>[<a href="./images/255.png">255</a>]</span>
heat she was wrapped to the ears in a great coat of
pale buff. On her head was a Chinese hat of yellow
straw, with a peacock's feather. Yet in spite of the
blueness and yellowness, and the redness of her
head, she preserved that air of amazing coolness,
as if her blood were mixed with snow and ran
slowly.</p>

<p>Arriving on deck, she gave Pip her hand. "I am
glad it is clear. I hate storms. I am going to ask
Dr. Brooks to pray that it won't be rough. He is a
good man, and the gods should listen."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3><i>In Which Fear Walks in a Storm.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> "Mermaid," having swept like a bird out
of the harbor, stopped at Coney Island. Marie-Louise
wanted her fortune told. Eve wanted peanuts
and pop-corn. "It will make me seem a little
girl again."</p>

<p>Marie-Louise, cool in her buff coat, shrugged her
shoulders. "I was never allowed to be that kind of
a little girl," she said, "but I think I'd like to try it
for a day."</p>

<p>Eve and Marie-Louise got on very well together.
They spoke the same language. And if Marie-Louise
was more artificial in some ways, she was
more open than Eve.</p>

<p>"You'd better tell Dr. Brooks," she told the older
girl, as the two of them walked ahead of Richard
and Pip on the pier. Tony and Winifred had elected
to stay on board.</p>

<p>"Tell him what?"</p>

<p>"That you are keeping the big man in reserve."</p>

<p>Eve flushed. "Marie-Louise, you're horrid."</p>

<p>"I am honest," was the calm response.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a>[<a href="./images/257.png">257</a>]</span>
Pip bought them unlimited peanuts and pop-corn,
and Marie-Louise piloted them to the tent of a fat
Armenian who told fortunes.</p>

<p>In spite of his fatness, however, he was immaculate
in European clothing; he charged exorbitantly
and achieved extraordinary results.</p>

<p>"He said the last time that I should marry a poet,"
Marie-Louise informed them, "which isn't true. I
am not going to be married at all. But it amuses
me to hear him."</p>

<p>The black eyes of the fat Armenian twinkled.
"There will be a time when you will not be amused.
You will be married."</p>

<p>He pulled out a chair for her. "Will your friends
stay while I tell you the rest?"</p>

<p>"No, they are children; they want to buy peanuts
and pop-corn&mdash;they want to play."</p>

<p>The others laughed. But the fat Armenian did
not laugh. "Your soul is old!"</p>

<p>"You see," she asked the others, "what I mean?
He says things like that to me. He told me once
that in a former incarnation I had walked beside the
Nile and had loved a king."</p>

<p>"A king-poet," the man corrected.</p>

<p>"Will you tell mine?" Eve asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"Certainly, madam."</p>

<p>"I am mademoiselle. You go first, Marie-Louise."</p>

<p>But Marie-Louise insisted on yielding to her.
"We will come back for you."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a>[<a href="./images/258.png">258</a>]</span>
Coming back, they found Eve in an irritable temper.
"He told me&mdash;nothing."</p>

<p>"I told you what you did not want to hear. But
I told you the truth."</p>

<p>"I don't believe in such things." Eve was lofty.
Her cold eyes challenged the Oriental. "I don't
believe you know anything about it."</p>

<p>"If Mademoiselle will write it down&mdash;&mdash;" He
was fat and puffy, but he had a sort of large dignity
which ignored her rudeness. "If Mademoiselle will
write it down, she will not say&mdash;next year&mdash;'I do
not believe.'"</p>

<p>She shivered. "I wish I hadn't come. Dicky
boy, let's go and play. Pip and Marie-Louise can
stay if they like it. I don't."</p>

<p>When Marie-Louise had had her imagination once
more fed on poets, kings, and previous incarnations,
she and Pip went forth to seek the others.</p>

<p>"I wonder what he told Eve?" Pip speculated.</p>

<p>Marie-Louise spoke with shrewdness. "He probably
told her that she would marry you&mdash;only he
wouldn't put it that way. He would say that in
reaching for a star she would stumble on a diamond."</p>

<p>"And is Brooks the star?"</p>

<p>She nodded, grinning. "And you are the diamond.
It is what she wants&mdash;diamonds."</p>

<p>"She wants more than that"&mdash;tenderness crept
into his voice&mdash;"she wants love&mdash;and I can give it."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>[<a href="./images/259.png">259</a>]</span>
"She wants Dr. Brooks. 'Most any woman
would," said Marie-Louise cruelly. "We all know
he is different. You know it, and I know it, and
Eve knows it. He is bigger in some ways, and
better!"</p>

<p>They found Eve and Richard in a pavilion dancing
in strange company, to raucous music. Later the
four of them rode on a merry-go-round, with Marie-Louise
on a dolphin and Eve on a swan, with the
two men mounted on twin dragons. They ate
chowder and broiled lobster in a restaurant high in
a fantastic tower. They swept up painted Alpine
slopes in reckless cars, they drifted through dark
tunnels in gorgeous gondolas. Eve took her pleasures
with a sort of feverish enthusiasm, Marie-Louise
with the air of a skeptic trying out a new thing.</p>

<p>"Mother would faint and fade away if she knew I
was here," Marie-Louise told Richard as she sat next
to him in a movie show, "and so would Dad. He
would object to the germs and she would object to
the crowd. Mother is like a flower in a sunlighted
garden. She can't imagine that a lily could grow
with its feet in the mud. But they do. And Dad
knows it. But he likes to have mother stay in the
sunlighted garden. He would never have fallen in
love with her if her roots had been in the mud."</p>

<p>She was murmuring this into Richard's ear. Eve
was on the other side of him, with Pip beyond.</p>

<p>"I've never had a day like this," Marie-Louise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a>[<a href="./images/260.png">260</a>]</span>
further confided, "and I am not sure that I like it.
It seems so far away from&mdash;Pan&mdash;and the trees&mdash;and
the river."</p>

<p>Her voice dropped into silence, and Richard sat
there beside her like a stone, seeing nothing of the
pictures thrown on the screen. He saw a road which
led between spired cedars, he saw an old house with
a wide porch. He saw a golden-lighted table, and
his mother's face across the candles. He saw a girl
in a brown coat scattering food for the birds with a
kind little hand&mdash;he heard the sound of a bell!</p>

<p>When they reached the yacht, Winifred was
dressed for dinner, and Eve and Marie-Louise scurried
below to change. They dined on the upper
deck by moonlight, and sat late enjoying the still
warmth of the night. There was no wind and they
seemed to sail through silver waters.</p>

<p>Marie-Louise sang for them. Strange little songs
for which she had composed both words and music.
They had haunting cadences, and Pip told her "For
Heaven's sake, kiddie, cheer up. You are making
us cry."</p>

<p>She laughed, and gave them a group of old
nursery rhymes. Most of them had to do with
things to eat. There was the Dame who baked her
pies "on Christmas day in the morning," and the
Queen who made the tarts, and Jenny Wren and her
currant wine.</p>

<p>"They are what I call appetizing," she said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a>[<a href="./images/261.png">261</a>]</span>
quaintly. "When I was a tiny tot Dad kept me on
a diet. I was never allowed to eat pies or tarts or
puddings. So I used to feast vicariously on my
nursery rhymes."</p>

<p>They laughed, as she had meant they should, and
Pip said, "Give us another," so she chanted with increasing
dramatic effect the story of King Arthur.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A bag pudding the king did make,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">And stuffed it well with plums,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">And in it put great hunks of fat,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">As big as my two thumbs&mdash;&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Think of the effect of those hunks of fat," she
explained amid their roars of laughter, "on my dieted
mind."</p>

<p>"I hate to think of things to eat," Eve said. "And
I can't imagine myself cooking&mdash;in a kitchen."</p>

<p>"Where else would you cook?" Marie-Louise demanded
practically. "I'd like it. I went once with
my nurse to her mother's house, and she was cooking
ham and frying eggs and we sat down to a table
with a red cloth and had the ham and eggs with
great slices of bread and strong tea. My nurse let
me eat all I wanted, because her mother said it
wouldn't hurt me, and it didn't. But my mother
never knew. And always after that I liked to think
of Lucy's mother and that warm nice kitchen, and
the plump, pleasant woman and the ham and eggs
and tea."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a>[<a href="./images/262.png">262</a>]</span>
She was very serious, but they roared again. She
was so far away from anything that was homely and
housewifely, with her red hair peaked up to a high
knot, her thick white coat with its black animal skin
enveloping her shoulders, the gleam of silver slippers.</p>

<p>"Dicky," Eve said, "I hope you are not expecting
me to cook in Arcadia."</p>

<p>"I don't expect anything."</p>

<p>"Every man expects something," Winifred interposed;
"subconsciously he wants a hearth-woman.
That's the primitive."</p>

<p>"I don't want a hearth-woman," Pip announced.</p>

<p>Dutton Ames chuckled. "You're a stone-age
man, Meade. You'd like to woo with a club, and
carry the day's kill to the woman in your tent."</p>

<p>A quick fire lighted Pip's eyes. "Jove, it wouldn't
be bad, would it? What do you think, Eve?"</p>

<p>"I like your yacht better, and your chef and your
alligator pears, and caviar."</p>

<p>An hour later Eve and Richard were alone on
deck. The others had gone down. The lovers had
preferred the moonlight.</p>

<p>"Eve, old lady," Richard said, "you know that
even with Austin's help I'm not going to be a Cr[oe]sus.
There won't be yachts&mdash;and chefs&mdash;and alligator
pears."</p>

<p>"Jealous, Dicky?"</p>

<p>"No. But you've always had these things, Eve."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a>[<a href="./images/263.png">263</a>]</span>
"I shall still have them. Aunt Maude won't let
us suffer. She's a good old soul."</p>

<p>"Do you think I shall care to partake of Aunt
Maude's bounty?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. But I am not so stiff-necked. Oh,
Ducky Dick, do you think that I am going to let
you keep on being poor and priggish and steady-minded?"</p>

<p>"Am I that, Eve?"</p>

<p>"You know you are."</p>

<p>Her laughing eyes challenged him. He would
have been less than a man if he had not responded
to the appeal of her youth and beauty. "Dicky,"
she said, "when we are married I am going to give
you the time of your young life. All work and no
play will make you a dull boy, Dicky."</p>

<p>In the night the clouds came up over the moon,
and when the late and lazy party appeared on deck
for luncheon, Marie-Louise complained. "I hate it
this way. There's going to be a storm."</p>

<p>There was a storm before night. It blew up
tearingly from the south and there was menace in it
and madness.</p>

<p>Winifred and Eve were good sailors. But Marie-Louise
went to pieces. She was frantic with fear,
and as the night wore on, Richard found himself
much concerned for her.</p>

<p>She insisted on staying on deck. "I feel like a
rat in a trap when I am inside. I want to face it."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a>[<a href="./images/264.png">264</a>]</span>
The wind was roaring about them. The sea was
black and the sky was black, a thick velvety black
that turned to copper when the lightning came.</p>

<p>"Aren't you afraid?" Marie-Louise demanded;
"aren't you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't you be? Why shouldn't anybody
be?"</p>

<p>"My nerves are strong, Marie-Louise."</p>

<p>"It isn't nerves. It's faith. You believe that the
boat won't go down, and you believe that if it did
go down your soul wouldn't die."</p>

<p>Her white face was close to him. "I wish I could
believe like that," she said in a high, sharp voice.
Then she screamed as the little ship seemed caught
up into the air and flung down again.</p>

<p>"Hush," Richard told her; "hush, Marie-Louise."</p>

<p>She was shaking and shivering. "I hate it," she
sobbed.</p>

<p>Pip, like a yellow specter in oilskins, came up to
them. "Eve wants you, Brooks," he shouted above
the clamor of wind and wave.</p>

<p>"Shall we go in, Marie-Louise?"</p>

<p>"No, no." She cowered against his arm.</p>

<p>Over her head Richard said to Pip, "I shall come
as soon as I can."</p>

<p>So Pip went down, and the two were left alone in
the tumult and blackness of the night.</p>

<p>As Marie-Louise lay for a moment quiet against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a>[<a href="./images/265.png">265</a>]</span>
his arm, Richard bent down to her. "Are you still
afraid?"</p>

<p>"Yes, oh, yes. I keep thinking&mdash;if I should die.
And I am afraid to die."</p>

<p>"You are not going to die. And if you were
there would be nothing to fear. Death is just&mdash;falling
asleep. Rarely any terror. We doctors
know, who see people die. I know it, and your
father knows it."</p>

<p>By the light of a blinding flash he saw her white
face with its wet red hair.</p>

<p>"Dad doesn't know it as you know," she said,
chokingly. "He couldn't say it as you&mdash;say it."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"He's like I am. <i>Dad's afraid.</i>"</p>

<p>The storm swept on, leaving the waves rough
behind it, and Richard at last put Marie-Louise to
bed with a sleeping powder. Then he went to hunt
up Eve. He was very tired and it was very late.
The night had passed, and the dawn would soon
be coming up over the horizon. He found Pip in
the smoking room. Eve had gone to bed. Everybody
had gone to bed. It had been a terrible storm.</p>

<p>Richard agreed that it had been terrible. He was
glad that Eve could sleep. He couldn't understand
why Austin had allowed Marie-Louise to take such
a trip. Her fear of storms was evidently quite uncontrollable.
And she was at all times hysterical
and high-strung.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a>[<a href="./images/266.png">266</a>]</span>
Pip was not interested in Marie-Louise. "Eve
lost her nerve at the last."</p>

<p>Richard was solicitous. "I'm sorry. I wanted
to come down, but I couldn't leave Marie-Louise.
Eve's normal, and she'll be all right as soon as the
storm stops. But Marie-Louise may suffer for days.
The sooner she gets on shore the better."</p>

<p>He went on deck, and looked out upon a gray
wind-swept world.</p>

<p>Then the sun came up, and there was a great light
upon the waters.</p>

<p>All the next day Marie-Louise lay in a long chair.
"Dad told me not to come," she confessed to Richard.
"I've been this way before. But I wouldn't
listen."</p>

<p>"If I had been your father," Richard said, "you
would have listened, and you would have stayed at
home."</p>

<p>She grinned. "You can't be sure. Nobody can
be sure. I don't like to take orders."</p>

<p>"Until you learn to take orders you aren't going
to amount to much, Marie-Louise."</p>

<p>"I amount to a great deal. And your ideas
are&mdash;old-fashioned; that's what your Eve says,
Dr. Dicky."</p>

<p>She looked at him through her long eyelashes.
"What's the matter with your Eve?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"She is punishing you, but you don't know it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a>[<a href="./images/267.png">267</a>]</span>
She is down-stairs playing bridge with Pip and Tony
and Win, and leaving you alone to meditate on your
sins. And you aren't meditating. You are talking
to me. I am going to write a poem about a Laggard
Lover. I'll make you a shepherd boy who sits on
the hills and watches his sheep. And when the girl
who loves him calls to him, he refuses to go&mdash;he
still watches&mdash;his sheep."</p>

<p>He looked puzzled. "I don't know in the least
what you are talking about."</p>

<p>"You are the shepherd. Your work is the sheep&mdash;Eve
is the girl. Your work will always be more
to you than the woman. Dad's work isn't. He
never forgets mother for a minute."</p>

<p>"And you think that I'll forget Eve?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And she'll hate that."</p>

<p>There was a spark in his eye.</p>

<p>"I think that we won't discuss Eve, Marie-Louise."</p>

<p>"Then I'll discuss her in a poem. Lend me a
pencil, please."</p>

<p>He gave her the pencil and a prescription pad,
and she set to work. She read snatches to him as
she progressed. It was remarkably clever, with a
constantly recurring refrain.</p>

<p>"<i>Let me watch my sheep," said the lover, "my
sheep on the hills.</i>"</p>

<p>The verses went on to relate that the girl, finding
her shepherd dilatory, turned her attention to another
swain, and at last she flouts the shepherd.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>[<a href="./images/268.png">268</a>]</span>
"<i>Go watch your sheep, laggard lover, your sheep on
the hills.</i>"</p>

<p>She laid the verses aside as Tony and Win joined
them.</p>

<p>"Three rubbers, and Pip and Eve are ahead."</p>

<p>"Isn't Eve coming?"</p>

<p>"She said she was coming up soon."</p>

<p>But she did not come, and Pip did not come.
Marie-Louise, with a great rug spread over her,
slept in her chair. Dutton Ames read aloud to his
wife. Richard rose and went to look for Eve.</p>

<p>There was a little room which Pip called "The
Skipper's own." It was furnished in a man's way
as a den, with green leather and carved oak and
plenty of books. Its windows gave a forward view
of sky and water.</p>

<p>It was here that the four of them had been playing
auction. Eve was now shuffling the cards for
Solitaire.</p>

<p>Pip, watching her, caught suddenly at her left
hand. "Why didn't Brooks give you a better
ring?"</p>

<p>"I like my ring. Let go of my hand, Pip."</p>

<p>"I won't. What's the matter with the man that
he should dare dream of tying you down to what he
can give you? It seems to me that he lacks pride."</p>

<p>"He doesn't lack anything. Let go of my hand,
Pip."</p>

<p>But he still held it. "How he could have the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a>[<a href="./images/269.png">269</a>]</span>
courage to ask&mdash;until he had made a name for
himself."</p>

<p>She blazed. "He didn't ask. I asked him, Pip.
I cared enough for that."</p>

<p>He dropped her hand as if it had stung him.
"You cared&mdash;as much as that?"</p>

<p>She faced him bravely. "As much as that&mdash;it
pleased me to say what it was my right to say."</p>

<p>"Oh! It was the queen, then, and the&mdash;beggar
man. <i>Eve</i>, come back."</p>

<p>She was at the door, but she turned. "I'll come
back if you will beg my pardon. Richard is not a
beggar, and I am not the queen. How hateful you
are, Pip."</p>

<p>"I won't beg your pardon. And let's have this
out right now, Eve."</p>

<p>"Have what out?"</p>

<p>"Sit down, and I'll tell you."</p>

<p>Once more they were seated with the table between
them. Pip's back was to the window, but Eve faced
the broad expanse of sky and sea. A faint pink flush
was on the waters: a silver star hung at the edge of
a crescent moon. There was no sound but the purr
of machinery and the mewing of gulls in the distance.</p>

<p>Eve was in pink&mdash;a straight linen frock with a low
white collar. It gave her an air of simplicity quite
unlike her usual elegance. Pip feasted his eyes on
her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a>[<a href="./images/270.png">270</a>]</span>
"You've got to face it. Brooks doesn't care."</p>

<p>"He does care."</p>

<p>"He didn't care enough to come down last night
when you were afraid&mdash;and wanted him. And you
turned to me, just for one little minute, Eve. Do
you think I shall ever forget the thrill of the thought
that you turned to me?"</p>

<p>She was staring straight out at the little moon.
"Marie-Louise was his patient&mdash;he had to stay with
her."</p>

<p>"You are saying that to me, but in your heart
you know you are resenting the fact that he didn't
come when you called. Aren't you, Eve? Aren't
you resenting it?"</p>

<p>She told him the truth. "Yes. But I know that
when I am his wife, I shall have to let him think
about his patients. I ought to be big enough for
that."</p>

<p>"You are big enough for anything. But you are
not always going to be content with crumbs from the
king's table. And that's what you are getting from
Brooks. And I have a feast ready. Eve, can't you
see that I would give, give, give, and he will take,
take, take? Eve, can't you see?"</p>

<p>She did see, and for the moment she was swayed
by the force of his passionate eloquence.</p>

<p>She leaned toward him a little. "Pip, dear, I
wish&mdash;sometimes&mdash;that it might have been&mdash;you."</p>

<p>It needed only this. He swept the card table<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a>[<a href="./images/271.png">271</a>]</span>
aside with his strong arms. He was on his knees
begging for love, for life. Her hair swept his cheek.</p>

<p>The little moon shone clear in the quiet sky.
There was not much light, but there was enough for
a man standing in the door to see two dark figures
outlined against the silver space beyond.</p>

<p>And Richard was standing in the door!</p>

<p>Eve saw him first. "Go away, Pip," she said,
and stood up. "I&mdash;I think I can make him understand."</p>

<p>When they were alone she said to Richard in a
strained voice, "It was my fault, Dicky."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you&mdash;let him, Eve?"</p>

<p>"No. But I let him talk about his love for me&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;he
cares very much."</p>

<p>"He knows that you are engaged to me."</p>

<p>"Yes. But last night when you stayed on deck
when I needed you and asked for you, Pip knew
that you wouldn't come&mdash;and he was sorry for me."</p>

<p>"And he was sorry again this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And he showed it by making love to you?"</p>

<p>"He thinks I won't be happy with you. He
thinks that you don't care. He thinks&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't care what Meade thinks. I want to know
what you think, Eve."</p>

<p>Their voices had come out of the darkness. She
pulled the little chain of a wall bracket, and the room
was enveloped in a warm wave of light. "I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a>[<a href="./images/272.png">272</a>]</span>
know what I think. But I hated to have you with
Marie-Louise."</p>

<p>"She was very ill. You knew that. Eve, if we
can't trust each other, what possible happiness can
there be ahead?"</p>

<p>She had no answer ready.</p>

<p>"Of course I can't stay on Meade's boat after
this," he went on; "I'll get them to run in here
somewhere and drop me."</p>

<p>She sank back in the chair from which she had
risen when Philip left them. His troubled eyes resting
upon her saw a blur of pink and gold out of which
emerged her white face.</p>

<p>"But I want you to stay."</p>

<p>"You shouldn't want me to stay, Eve. I can't
accept his hospitality, after this, and call myself&mdash;a
man."</p>

<p>"Oh, Dicky&mdash;I detest heroics."</p>

<p>She was startled by the tone in which he said, "If
that is the way you feel about it, we might as well
end it here."</p>

<p>"Dicky&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean it, Eve. The whole thing is based
on the fact that I stayed with a patient when you
wanted me. Well, I shall always be staying with
patients after we are married, and if you are unable
to see why I must do the thing I did last night, then
you will never be able to see it. And a doctor's wife
must see it."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a>[<a href="./images/273.png">273</a>]</span>
She came up to him, and in the darkness laid her
cheek against his arm. "Dicky, don't joke about a
thing like that. I can't stand it. And I'm sorry
about&mdash;Pip. Dicky, I shall die if you don't forgive
me."</p>

<p>He forgave her. He even made himself believe
that Pip might be forgiven. He exerted himself to
seem at his ease at dinner. He said nothing more
about leaving at the next landing.</p>

<p>But late that night he sat alone on deck in the
darkness. He was a plain man, and he saw things
straight. And this thing was crooked. The hot
honor of his youth revolted against the situation in
which he saw himself. He felt hurt and ashamed.
It was as if the dreams of his boyhood had been
dragged in the dust.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3><i>In Which We Hear Once More of a Sandalwood Fan.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the winter which followed Richard often wondered
if he were the same man who had ridden
his old Ben up over the hills, and had said his
solemn grace at his own candle-lighted table.</p>

<p>It had been decided that he and Eve should
wait until another year for their wedding. Richard
wanted to get a good start. Eve was impatient, but
acquiesced.</p>

<p>It was not Richard's engagement, however, which
gave to his life the effect of strangeness. It was,
rather, his work, which swept him into a maelstrom
of new activities. Austin needed rest and he knew
it. Richard was young and strong. The older man,
using his assistant as a buffer between himself and
a demanding public, felt no compunction. His own
apprenticeship had been hard.</p>

<p>So Richard in Austin's imposing limousine was
whirled through fashionable neighborhoods and up
to exclusive doorways. He presided at operations
where the fees were a year's income for a poor man.
A certain percentage of these fees came to him. He
found that he need have no fears for his financial
future.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a>[<a href="./images/275.png">275</a>]</span>
His letters from his mother were his only link
with the old life. She wrote that she was well.
That Anne Warfield was with her, and Cousin Sulie,
and that the three of them and Cousin David played
whist. That Anne was such a dear&mdash;that she didn't
know what she would do without her.</p>

<p>Richard went as often as he could on Sundays to
Crossroads. But at such times he saw little of Anne.
She felt that no one should intrude on the reunions
of mother and son. So she visited at Beulah's or
Bower's and came back on Mondays.</p>

<p>Nancy persisted in her refusal to go back to New
York. "I know I am silly," she told her son, "but
I have a feeling that I shouldn't be able to breathe,
and should die of suffocation."</p>

<p>Richard spoke to Dr. Austin of his mother's state
of mind. "Queer thing, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"A natural thing, I should say. Your father's
death was an awful blow. I often wonder how she
lived out the years while she waited for you to
finish school."</p>

<p>"But she did live them, so that I might be prepared
to practice at Crossroads. As I think of it,
it seems monstrous that I should disappoint her."</p>

<p>"Fledglings always leave the nest. Mothers have
that to expect. The selfishness of the young makes
for progress. It would have been equally monstrous
if you had stayed in that dull place wasting your
talents."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a>[<a href="./images/276.png">276</a>]</span>
"Would it have been wasted, sir? There's no
one taking my place in the old country. And there
are many who could fill it here. There's a chance
at Crossroads for big work for the right man. Community
water supply&mdash;better housing, the health
conditions of the ignorant foreign folk who work
the small farms. A country doctor ought to have
the missionary spirit."</p>

<p>"There are plenty of little men for such places."</p>

<p>"It takes big men. I could make our old countryside
bloom like a rose if I could put into it half the
effort that I am putting into my work with you.
But it would be lean living&mdash;and I have chosen the
flesh-pots."</p>

<p>"Don't despise yourself because you couldn't go
on being poor in a big way. You are going to be
rich in a big way, and that is better."</p>

<p>As the days went on, however, Richard wondered
if it were really better to be rich in a big way.
Sometimes the very bigness and richness oppressed
him. He found himself burdened by the splendor
of the mansions at which he made his morning calls.
He hated the sleekness of the men in livery who
preceded him up the stairs, the trimness of the maids
waiting on the threshold of hushed boudoirs. Disease
and death in these sumptuous palaces seemed
divorced from reality as if the palaces were stage
structures, and the people in them were actors who
would presently walk out into the wings.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a>[<a href="./images/277.png">277</a>]</span>
It was therefore with some of the feelings which
had often assailed him when he had stepped from
a dim theater out into the open air that Richard
made his way one morning to a small apartment on
a down-town side street to call on a little girl who
had recently left the charity ward at Austin's hospital.
Richard had operated for appendicitis, and
had found himself much interested in the child. He
had dismissed the limousine farther up. It had
seemed out of place in the shabby street.</p>

<p>He stopped at the florist's for a pot of pink posies
and at another shop for fruit. Laden with parcels
he climbed the high stairs to the top floor of the
tenement.</p>

<p>The little girl and her grandmother lived together.
The grandmother had a small pension, and sewed
by the day for several old customers. They thus
managed to pay expenses, but poverty pinched.
Richard had from the first, however, been impressed
by their hopefulness. Neither the grandmother nor
the child seemed to look upon their lot as hard. The
grandmother made savory stews on a snug little
stove and baked her own sweet loaves. Now and
then she baked a cake. Things were spotlessly
clean, and there were sunshine and fresh air. To
have pitied those two would have been superfluous.</p>

<p>After he had walked briskly out into Fifth Avenue,
he was thinking of another grandmother on whom
he had called a few days before. She was a haughty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a>[<a href="./images/278.png">278</a>]</span>
old dame, but she was browbeaten by her maid. Her
grandchildren were brought in now and then to kiss
her hand. They were glad to get away. They had
no real need of her. They had no hopes or fears to
confide. So in spite of her magnificence and her
millions, she was a lonely soul.</p>

<p>Snow had fallen the night before, and was now
melting in the streets, but the sky was very blue
above the tall buildings. Christmas was not far
away, and as Richard went up-town the crowd surged
with him, meeting the crowd that was coming down.</p>

<p>He had a fancy to lunch at a little place on Thirty-third
Street, where they served a soup with noodles
that was in itself a hearty meal. In the days when
money had been scarce the little German caf&eacute; had
furnished many a feast. Now and then he and his
mother had come together, and had talked of how,
when their ship came in, they would dine at the big
hotel around the corner.</p>

<p>And now that his ship was in, and he could afford
the big hotel, it had no charms. He hated the
women dawdling in its alleys, the men smoking in
its corridors, the whole idle crowd, lunching in acres
of table-crowded space.</p>

<p>So he set as his goal the clean little restaurant,
and swung along toward it with something of his old
boyish sense of elation.</p>

<p>And then a strange thing happened. For the first
time in months he found his heart marking time to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a>[<a href="./images/279.png">279</a>]</span>
the tune of the song which old Ben's hoofs had beaten
out of the roads as they made their way up into the
hills&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>He was even humming it under his breath, unheard
amid the hum and stir of the crowded city street.</p>

<p>The shops on either side of him displayed in their
low windows a wealth of tempting things. Rugs
with a sheen like the bloom of a peach&mdash;alabaster in
curved and carved bowls and vases, old prints in dull
gilt frames&mdash;furniture following the lines of Florentine
elaborateness&mdash;his eyes took in all the color and
glow, though he rarely stopped for a closer view.</p>

<p>In front of one broad window, however, he hesitated.
The opening of the door had spilled into the
frosty air of this alien city the scent of the Orient&mdash;the
fragrance of incense&mdash;of spicy perfumed woods.</p>

<p>In the window a jade god sat high on a teakwood
pedestal. A string of scarlet beads lighted a shadowy
corner. On an ancient and priceless lacquered
cabinet were enthroned two other gods of gold and
ivory. A crystal ball reflected a length of blue
brocade. A clump of Chinese bulbs bloomed in an
old Ming bowl.</p>

<p>Richard went into the shop. Subconsciously, he
went with a purpose. But the purpose was not revealed
to him until he came to a case in which was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a>[<a href="./images/280.png">280</a>]</span>
set forth a certain marvelous collection. He knew
then that the old song and the scents had formed an
association of ideas which had lured him away from
the streets and into the shop, that he might buy for
Anne Warfield a sandalwood fan.</p>

<p>He found what he wanted. A sweet and wonderful
bit of wood, carved like lace, with green and
purple tassels.</p>

<p>It was when he had it safe in his pocket, in a box
that was gay with yellow and green and gold, that
he was aware of voices in the back of the shop.</p>

<p>There were tables where tea was served to special
customers&mdash;at the expense of the management.
Thus a vulgar bargain became as it were a hospitality&mdash;you
bought teakwood and had tea; carved
ivories, and were rewarded with little cakes.</p>

<p>In that dim space under a low hung lamp, Marie-Louise
talked with the fat Armenian.</p>

<p>He was the same Armenian who had told her fortune
at Coney. He stood by Marie-Louise's side
while she drank her tea, and spoke to her of the poet-king
with whom she had walked on the banks of the
Nile.</p>

<p>Richard approaching asked, "How did you happen
to come here, Marie-Louise?"</p>

<p>"I often come. I like it. It is next to traveling
in far countries." She indicated the fat Armenian.
"He tells me about things that happened to me&mdash;in
the ages&mdash;when I lived before."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a>[<a href="./images/281.png">281</a>]</span>
A slender youth in white silk with a crimson sash
brought tea for Richard. But he refused it. "I am
on my way to lunch, Marie-Louise. Will you go
with me?"</p>

<p>She hesitated and glanced at the fat Armenian.
"I've some things to buy."</p>

<p>"I'll wait."</p>

<p>She flitted about the shop with the fat Armenian
in her train. He showed her treasures shut away
from the public eye, and she bought long lengths of
heavy silks, embroideries thick with gold, a moonstone
bracelet linked with silver.</p>

<p>The fat Armenian, bending over her, seemed to
direct and suggest. Richard, watching, hated the
man's manner.</p>

<p>Outside in the sunshine, he spoke of it. "I
wouldn't go there alone."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I don't like to see you among those people&mdash;on
such terms. They don't understand, and they're&mdash;different."</p>

<p>"I like them because they are different," obstinately.</p>

<p>He shifted his ground. "Marie-Louise, will you
lunch with me at a cheap little place around the
corner?"</p>

<p>"Why a cheap little place?"</p>

<p>"Because I like the good soup, and the clean little
German woman, and the quiet and&mdash;the memories.<ins class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">"</ins></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a>[<a href="./images/282.png">282</a>]</span>
"What memories?"</p>

<p>"I used to go there when I was poor."</p>

<p>She entered eagerly into the adventure, and
ordered her car to wait. Then away they fared
around the corner!</p>

<p>Within the homely little restaurant, Marie-Louise's
elegance was more than ever apparent. Her long
coat of gray velvet with its silver fox winked opulently
from the back of her chair at the coarse table-cloth
and the paper napkins.</p>

<p>But the soup was good, and the German woman
smiled at them, and brought them a special dish of
hard almond cakes with their coffee.</p>

<p>"I love it," Marie-Louise said. "It is like Hans
Andersen and my fairy books. Will you bring me
here again, Dr. Richard?"</p>

<p>"I am glad you like it," he told her. "I wanted
you to like it."</p>

<p>"I like it because I like you," she said with frankness,
"and you seem to belong in the fairy tale.
You are so big and strong and young. I don't feel
a thousand years old when I am with you. You are
such a change from everybody else, Dr. Dicky."</p>

<p>Richard spoke the next day to Austin of Marie-Louise
and the fat Armenian. "She shouldn't be
going to such shops alone. She has a romantic
streak in her, and they take advantage of it."</p>

<p>"She ought never to go alone," Austin agreed,
"and I have told her. But what am I going to do?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a>[<a href="./images/283.png">283</a>]</span>
I can rule a world of patients, Brooks, but I can't
rule my woman child," he laughed ruefully. "I've
tried having a maid accompany her, but she sends
her home."</p>

<p>"I wish she might have gone to the Crossroads
school, and have known the Crossroads teacher&mdash;Anne
Warfield. You remember Cynthia Warfield,
sir; this is her granddaughter."</p>

<p>Austin remembered Cynthia, and he wanted to
know more of Anne. Richard told him of Anne's
saneness and common sense. "I am so glad that
she can be with my mother, and that the children
have her in the school. She is so wise and good."</p>

<p>He thought more than once in the days that followed
of Anne's wisdom and goodness. He decided
to send the fan. He expected to go to Crossroads
for Christmas, but he was not at all sure that he
should see Anne. Something had been said about
her going for the holidays to her Uncle Rod.</p>

<p>Was it only a year since he had seen her on the
rocks above the river with a wreath in her hand, and
in the stable at Bower's, with the lantern shining
above her head?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3><i>In Which Christmas Comes to Crossroads.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Nancy's</span> plans for Christmas were ambitious.
She talked it over with Sulie Tyson. "I'll
have Anne and her Uncle Rod. If she goes to him
they will eat their Christmas dinner alone. Her
cousins are to be out of town."</p>

<p>Cousin Sulie agreed. She was a frail little woman,
with gray hair drawn up from her forehead above a
high-bred face. She spoke with earnestness on even
the most trivial subjects. Now and then she had
flashes of humor, but they were rare. Her life had
been sad, and she had always been dependent. The
traditions of her family had made it impossible for
her to indulge in any money-making occupation.
Hence she had lived in other people's houses. Usually
with one or the other of two brothers, in somewhat
large households.</p>

<p>Her days, therefore, with Nancy were rapturous
ones.</p>

<p>"There's something in the freedom which two
women can have when they are alone," she said,
"that is glorious. We are ourselves. When men
are around we are always acting."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a>[<a href="./images/285.png">285</a>]</span>
Nancy was not so subtle. "I am myself with
Richard."</p>

<p>"No, you're not, Nancy. You are always trying
to please him. You make him feel important. You
make him feel that he is the head of the house.
You know what I mean."</p>

<p>Nancy did know. But she didn't choose to admit
it.</p>

<p>"Well, I like to please him." Then with a sudden
burst of longing, "Sulie, I want him here all of
the time&mdash;to please."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear," Sulie caught Nancy's hands up
in her own, "oh, my dear. How mothers love their
sons. I am glad I haven't any. I used to long for
children. I don't any more. Nothing can hurt me
as Richard hurts you, Nancy."</p>

<p>Nancy refused to talk of it. "We will ask David
and Brinsley; that will be four men and three
women, Sulie."</p>

<p>"Well, I can take care of David if you'll look after
Brinsley and Rodman Warfield. And that will leave
your Richard for Anne."</p>

<p>Nancy's candid glance met her cousin's. "That
is the way I had hoped it might be&mdash;Richard and
Anne. At first I thought it might be&mdash;and then
something happened. He went to New York and
that was the&mdash;end."</p>

<p>"If you had been more of a match-maker," Sulie
said, "you might have managed. But you always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a>[<a href="./images/286.png">286</a>]</span>
think that such things are on the knees of the gods.
Why didn't you bring them together?"</p>

<p>"I tried," Nancy confessed. "But Eve&mdash;I hate
to say it, Sulie. Eve was determined."</p>

<p>The two old-fashioned women, making mental
estimates of this modern feminine product, found
themselves indignant. "To think that any girl
could&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was lunch time, and Anne came in. She had
Diogenes under her arm. "He will come across
the road to meet me. And I am afraid of the automobiles.
When he brings the white duck and all of
the little Diogenes with him he obstructs traffic.
He stopped a touring car the other day, and the
men swore at him, and Diogenes swore back."</p>

<p>She laughed and set the old drake on his feet.
"May I have a slice of bread for him, Mother
Nancy?"</p>

<p>"Of course, my dear. Two, if you wish."</p>

<p>Diogenes, having been towed by his beloved mistress
out-of-doors, was appeased with the slice of
bread. He was a patriarch now, with a lovely mate
and a line of waddling offspring to claim his devotion.
But not an inch did he swerve from his loyalty
to Anne. She had brought him with her from
Bower's, and he lived in the barn with his family.
Twice a day, however, he made a pilgrimage to the
Crossroads school. It was these excursions which
Anne deprecated.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a>[<a href="./images/287.png">287</a>]</span>
"He comes in when I ring for recess and distracts
the children. He waddles straight up to my desk&mdash;and
he is such an old dear."</p>

<p>She laughed, and the two women laughed with
her. She was their heart-warming comrade. She
brought into their lonely lives something vivid and
sparkling, at which they drank for their soul's refreshment.</p>

<p>Nancy spoke of Rodman Warfield. "We want
him here for Christmas and the holidays. Do you
think he can come?"</p>

<p>Anne flashed her radiance at them. "I don't
think. I know. Mother Nancy, you're an angel."</p>

<p>"Richard is coming, of course. It will be just a
family party. Not many young people for you, my
dear. Just&mdash;Richard."</p>

<p>There was holly and crow's-foot up in the hills,
and David and Anne hitched big Ben to a cart and
went after it. It was a winter of snow, and in the
depths of the woods there was a great stillness.
David chopped a tall cedar and his blows echoed
and re&euml;choed in the white spaces. The holly berries
that dropped from the cut branches were like drops
of blood on the shining crust.</p>

<p>Nancy and Sulie made up the wreaths and the
ropes of green, and fashioned ornaments for the
tree. There was to be a bigger tree at the school
for the children, but this was to be a family affair
and was to be free from tawdry tinsel and colored<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a>[<a href="./images/288.png">288</a>]</span>
glass. Nancy liked straight little candles and silver
stars. "It shall be an old-fashioned tree," she
said, "such as I used to have when I was a child."</p>

<p>Sulie's raptures were almost solemn in their intensity.
Richard sent money, plenty of it, and Sulie
and Nancy went to Baltimore and spent it. "I
never expected," Sulie said, "to go into shops and
pick out things that I liked. I've always had to
choose things that I needed."</p>

<p>Now and then on Saturdays when Anne went
with them, they rushed through their shopping, had
lunch at the Woman's Exchange and went to a
matin&eacute;e.</p>

<p>Nancy was always glad to get back home, but
Sulie revelled in the excitement of it all. Anne
made her buy a hat with a flat pink rose which lay
enchantingly against her gray hair.</p>

<p>"I feel sometimes as if I had been born again,"
Sulie said quaintly; "like a flower that had shriveled
up and grown brown, and suddenly found itself
blooming in the spring."</p>

<p>Thus the days went on, and Christmas was not far
away. Anne coming in one afternoon found Nancy
by the library fire with a letter in her hand.</p>

<p>"Richard hopes to get here on Friday, Anne, in
time for the tree and the children's festival. Something
may keep him, however, until Christmas
morning. He is very busy&mdash;and there are some
important operations."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a>[<a href="./images/289.png">289</a>]</span>
"How proud you are of him," Anne sank down
on the rug, and reached up her hand for Nancy,
"and how happy you will be with your big son.
Could you ever have loved a daughter as much,
Mother Nancy?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure; perhaps," smiling, "if she had
been like you. And a daughter would have stayed
with me. Men have wandering natures&mdash;they must
be up and out."</p>

<p>"Women have wandering natures, too," Anne
told her. "Do you know that last Christmas I cried
and cried because I was tied to the Crossroads school
and to Bower's? I wanted to live in the city and
have lovely things. You can't imagine how I hated
all Eve Chesley's elegance. I seemed so&mdash;clumsy
and common."</p>

<p>Nancy stared at her in amazement. "But you
surely don't feel that way now."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. But I am not unhappy any more.
It was silly to be unhappy when I had so much in
my life. But if I were a man, I'd be a rover, a vagabond&mdash;I'd
take to the open road rather than be tied
to one spot."</p>

<p>There was laughter in her eyes, but the words
rang true. "I want to see new things in new people.
I want to have new experiences&mdash;there must
be a bigger, broader world than this."</p>

<p>Nancy gazing into the fire pondered. "It's the
spirit of the age. Perhaps it is the youth in you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a>[<a href="./images/290.png">290</a>]</span>
I wanted to go, too. But oh, my dear, how I wanted
to come back!"</p>

<p>There was silence between them, then Anne said,
"Perhaps if I could have my one little fling I'd be
content. Perhaps it wouldn't be all that I expected.
But I'd like to try."</p>

<p>On Thursday Anne met the postman as he drove
up. There were two parcels for her. One was
square and one was long and narrow. There were
parcels also for Nancy and Sulie. Anne delivered
them, and took her own treasures to her room. She
shut and locked her door. Then she stood very still
in the middle of the room. Not since she had seen
the writing on the long and narrow parcel had her
heart ceased to beat madly.</p>

<p>When at last she sat down and untied the string
a faint fragrance assailed her nostrils. Then the
gay box with its purple and green and gold was
revealed!</p>

<p>The little fan was folded about with many thicknesses
of soft paper. But at last she had it out, the
dear lovely thing that her love had sent!</p>

<p>In that moment all the barriers which she had
built about her thoughts of Richard were beaten
down and battered by his remembrance of her.
There was not a line from him, not a word. Nothing
but the writing on the wrapper, and the memory
of their talk together by the big fire at Bower's on
the night of Beulah's party when he had said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a>[<a href="./images/291.png">291</a>]</span>
"You ought to have a little fan&mdash;of&mdash;sandalwood&mdash;with
purple and green tassels and smelling sweet."</p>

<p>When she went down her cheeks were red with
color. "How pretty you are!" Sulie said, and
kissed her.</p>

<p>Anne showed the book which had come in the
square parcel. It was Geoffrey Fox's "Three Souls,"
and it was dedicated to Anne.</p>

<p>She did not show the sandalwood fan. It was
hidden in her desk. She had a feeling that Nancy
and Sulie would not understand, and that Richard
had not meant that she should show it.</p>

<p>Nancy, too, had something which she did not
show. One of her letters was from Dr. Austin. He
had written without Richard's knowledge. He
wished to inquire about Anne Warfield. He had
been much impressed by what Richard had said of
her. He needed a companion for his daughter
Marie-Louise. He wanted a lady, and Cynthia
Warfield's grandchild would, of course, be that. He
wanted, too, some one who was fearless, and who
thought straight. He fancied that from what Richard
had said that Anne would be the antidote for
his daughter's abnormality. If Nancy would confirm
Richard's opinion, he would write at once to
Miss Warfield. A woman's estimate in such a matter
would, naturally, be more satisfying. He would
pay well, and Anne would be treated in every way
as one of the family. Marie-Louise might at first be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>[<a href="./images/292.png">292</a>]</span>
a little difficult. But in the end, no doubt, she would
yield to tact and firmness.</p>

<p>And he was always devotedly, her old friend!</p>

<p>It had seemed to Nancy as she read that something
gripped at her heart. It was Anne's presence
which had kept her from the black despair of loneliness.
Sulie was good and true, but she had no
power to fill the void made by Richard's absence.
If Anne went away, they would be two old women,
gazing blankly into an empty future.</p>

<p>Yet it was Anne's opportunity. The opportunity
which her soul had craved. "To see new things and
new people." And she was young and wanting much
to live. It would not be right or fair to hold her back.</p>

<p>She had, however, laid the letter aside. When
Richard came she would talk it over with him, and
then they could talk to Anne. She tried to forget
it in the bustle of preparation, but it lay like a
shadow in the back of her mind, dimming the brightness
of the days.</p>

<p>Everybody was busy. Milly and Sulie and Nancy
seeded and chopped and baked, and polished silver,
and got out piles of linen, and made up beds, and
were all beautifully ready and swept and garnished
when Uncle Rodman arrived from Carroll and
Brinsley from Baltimore.</p>

<p>The two old men came on the same train, and
David brought them over from Bower's behind big
Ben. By the time they reached Crossroads, they had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a>[<a href="./images/293.png">293</a>]</span>
dwelt upon old times and old friends and old loves
until they were in the warm and genial state of content
which is age's recompense for the loss of youthful
ardors.</p>

<p>They were, indeed, three ancient Musketeers,
who, untouched now by any flame of great emotion,
might adventure safely in a past of sentiment from
which they were separated by long years. But
there had been a time when passion had burned
brightly for them all, even in gentle David, who had
loved Cynthia Warfield.</p>

<p>What wonder, then, if to these three Anne typified
that past, and all it meant to them, as she ran
to meet them with her arms outflung to welcome
Uncle Rod.</p>

<p>She had them all presently safe on the hearth
with the fire roaring, and with Milly bringing them
hot coffee, and Sulie and Nancy smiling in an ecstasy
of welcome.</p>

<p>"It is perfect," Anne said, "to have you all here&mdash;like
this."</p>

<p>Yet deep in her heart she knew that it was not
perfect. For youth calls to youth. And Richard
was yet to come!</p>

<p>Brinsley had brought hampers of things to eat.
He had made epicurean pilgrimages to the Baltimore
markets. There were turkeys and ducks and
oysters&mdash;Smithfield hams, a young pig with an apple
in its mouth.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a>[<a href="./images/294.png">294</a>]</span>
He superintended the unloading of the hampers
when Eric brought them over. Uncle Rod shook
his head as he saw them opened.</p>

<p>"I can make a jar of honey and a handful of almonds
suffice," he said. "I am not keen about
butchered birds and beasts."</p>

<p>Brinsley laughed. "Don't rob me of the joy of
living, Rod," he said. "Nancy is bad enough. I
wanted to send up some wine. But she wouldn't
have it. Even her mince pies are innocent. Nancy
sees the whole world through eyes of anxiety for
her boy. I don't believe she'd care a snap for temperance
if she wasn't afraid that her Dicky might
drink."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is the individual mother's solicitude
for her own particular child which makes the feminine
influence a great moral force," Rodman ventured.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," carelessly. "Now Nancy has a set of
wine-glasses that it is a shame not to use." He
slapped his hands to warm them. "Let's take a
long walk, Rod. I exercise to keep the fat down."</p>

<p>"I exercise because it is a good old world to walk
in," and Rodman swung his long lean legs into an
easy stride.</p>

<p>They picked David up as they passed his little
house. They climbed the hill till they came to the
edge of the wood where David had cut the tree.</p>

<p>There was a sunset over the frozen river as they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a>[<a href="./images/295.png">295</a>]</span>
turned to look at it. The river sang no songs to-day.
It was as still and silent as their own dead
youth. Yet above it was the clear gold of the evening
sky.</p>

<p>"The last time we came we were boys," Brinsley
said, "and I was in love with Cynthia Warfield.
And we were both in love with her, David; do you
remember?"</p>

<p>David did remember. "Anne is like her."</p>

<p>Rodman protested. "She is and she isn't. Anne
has none of Cynthia's faults."</p>

<p>Brinsley chuckled. "I'll bet you've spoiled her."</p>

<p>"No, I haven't. But Anne has had to work and
wait for things, and it hasn't hurt her."</p>

<p>"She's a beauty," Brinsley stated, "and she
ought to be a belle."</p>

<p>"She's good," David supplemented; "the children
at the little school worship her."</p>

<p>"She's mine," Uncle Rod straightened his shoulders,
"and in that knowledge I envy no man
anything."</p>

<p>As they sat late that night by Nancy's fire, Anne
in a white frock played for them, and sang:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I think she was the most beautiful lady<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">That ever was in the West Country,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">But beauty vanishes, beauty passes,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">However rare, rare it be,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">And when I am gone, who shall remember<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">That lady of the West Country?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a>[<a href="./images/296.png">296</a>]</span>And when she sang it was of Cynthia Warfield that
all of the Old Gentlemen dreamed.</p>

<p>When the last note had died away, she went over
and stood behind her uncle. She was little and
slim and straight and her soft hair was swept up
high from her forehead. Her eyes above Uncle
Rod's head met Nancy's eyes. The two women
smiled at each other.</p>

<p>"To-morrow," Nancy said, and she seemed to say
it straight to Anne, "to-morrow Richard will be
here."</p>

<p>Anne caught a quick breath. "To-morrow," she
said. "How lovely it will be!"</p>

<p>But Richard did not come on Christmas Eve. A
telegram told of imperative demands on him. He
would get there in the morning.</p>

<p>"We won't light the tree until he comes," was
Nancy's brave decision. "The early train will get
him here in time for breakfast."</p>

<p>David drove big Ben down to meet him. Milly
cooked a mammoth breakfast. Anne slipped across
the road to the Crossroads school to ring the bell for
the young master's return. The rest of the household
waited in the library. Brinsley was there with
a story to tell, but no one listened. Their ears were
strained to catch the first sharp sound of big Ben's
trot. Sulie was there with a red rose in her hair to
match the fires which were warming her old heart.
Nancy was there at the window, watching.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a>[<a href="./images/297.png">297</a>]</span>
Then the telephone rang. Nancy was wanted.
Long distance.</p>

<p>It was many minutes before she came back. Yet
the message had been short. She had hung up the
receiver, and had stood in the hall in a whirling
world of darkness.</p>

<p><i>Richard was not coming.</i></p>

<p>He had been sorry. Tender. Her own sweet
son. Yet he had seemed to think that business was
a sufficient excuse for breaking her heart. Surely
there were doctors enough in that octopus of a
town to take his patients off of his hands. And she
was his mother and wanted him.</p>

<p>She had a sense of utter rebellion. She wanted
to cry out to the world, "This is my son, for whom
I have sacrificed."</p>

<p>And now the bell across the street began to ring
its foolish chime&mdash;Richard was not coming, <i>ding,
dong</i>. She must get through the day without him,
<i>ding, dong</i>, she must get through all the years!</p>

<p>When she faced the solicitous group in the library,
only her whiteness showed what she was feeling.</p>

<p>"Richard is detained by&mdash;an important&mdash;operation.
And breakfast is&mdash;waiting. Sulie, will you
call Anne, and light the little tree?"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3><i>In Which a Dresden-China Shepherdess and a Country
Mouse Meet on Common Ground.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Marie-louise's</span> room at Rose Acres was all
in white with two tall candlesticks to light it,
and a silver bowl for flowers. It was by means of
the flowers in the bowl that Marie-Louise expressed
her moods. There were days when scarlet flowers
flamed, and other days when pale roses or violets or
lilies suggested a less exotic state of mind.</p>

<p>On the day when Anne Warfield arrived, the
flowers in the bowl were yellow. Marie-Louise
stayed in bed all of the morning. She had ordered
the flowers sent up from the hothouse, and, dragging
a length of silken dressing-gown behind her,
she had arranged them. Then she had had her
breakfast on a tray.</p>

<p>Her hair was nicely combed under a lace cap; the
dressing-gown was faint blue. In the center of the
big bed she looked very small but very elegant, as
if a Dresden-China Shepherdess had been put between
the covers.</p>

<p>She had told her maid that when Anne arrived
she was to be shown up at once. Austin had sug<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a>[<a href="./images/299.png">299</a>]</span>gested
that Marie-Louise go down-town to meet her.
But Marie-Louise had refused.</p>

<p>"I don't want to see her. Why should I?"</p>

<p>"She is very charming, Marie-Louise."</p>

<p>"Who told you?"</p>

<p>"Dr. Brooks. And I knew her grandmother."</p>

<p>"Will Dr. Dicky meet her?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And bring her out. I have given him the
day."</p>

<p>"You might have asked me if I wanted her, Dad.
I don't want anybody to look after me. I belong to
myself."</p>

<p>"I don't know to whom you belong, Marie-Louise.
You're a changeling."</p>

<p>"I'm not. I'm your child. But you don't like
my horns and hoofs."</p>

<p>He gazed at her aghast. "My dear child!"</p>

<p>She began to sob. "I am not your dear child.
But I am your child, and I shall hate to have somebody
tagging around."</p>

<p>"Miss Warfield is not to tag. And you'll like her."</p>

<p>"I shall hate her," said Marie-Louise, between her
teeth.</p>

<p>It was because of this hatred that she had filled
her bowl with yellow flowers. Yellow meant jealousy.
And she had shrewdly analyzed her state of
mind. She was jealous of Anne because Dad and
Dr. Richard and everybody else thought that Anne
was going to set her a good example.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a>[<a href="./images/300.png">300</a>]</span>
It was early in January that Anne came. The
whole thing had been hurried. Austin had been
peremptory in his demand that she should not delay.
So Nancy, very white but smiling, had packed
her off. Sulie had cried over her, and Uncle Rod
had wished her "Godspeed."</p>

<p>Richard met her at the station in the midst of a
raging blizzard, and in a sort of dream she had
been whirled with him through the gray streets
shut in by the veil of the falling snow. They had
stopped for tea at a big hotel, which had seemed
as they entered to swim in a sea of golden light.
And now here she was at last in this palace of a
house!</p>

<p>Therese led her straight to Marie-Louise.</p>

<p>The Dresden-China Shepherdess in bed looked
down the length of the shadowed room to the door.
The figure that stood on the threshold was somehow
different from what she had expected. Smaller.
More girlish. Lovelier.</p>

<p>Anne, making her way across a sea of polished
floor, became aware of the Shepherdess in bed.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "I am sorry you are ill."</p>

<p>"I am not ill," said Marie-Louise. "I didn't want
you to come."</p>

<p>Anne smiled. "Oh, but if you knew how much
I <i>wanted</i> to come."</p>

<p>Marie-Louise sat up. "What made you want to
come?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a>[<a href="./images/301.png">301</a>]</span>
"Because I am a country mouse, and I wanted
to see the world."</p>

<p>"Rose Acres isn't the world."</p>

<p>"New York is. To me. There is so much that I
haven't seen. It is going to be a great adventure."</p>

<p>The Dresden-China Shepherdess fell down flat.
"So that's what you've come for," she said, dully,
"adventures&mdash;here."</p>

<p>There was a long silence, out of which Anne
asked, "How many miles is it to my room?"</p>

<p>"Miles?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You see, I am not used to such great
houses."</p>

<p>"It is down the hall in the west wing."</p>

<p>"If I get lost it will be my first adventure."</p>

<p>Marie-Louise turned and took a good look at this
girl who made so much out of nothing. Then she
said, "Therese will show you. And you can dress
at once for dinner. I am not going down."</p>

<p>"Please do. I shall hate going alone."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, there's your father, you know, and your&mdash;mother.
And I'm a country mouse."</p>

<p>Their eyes met. Marie-Louise had a sudden feeling
that there was no gulf between them of years or
of authority.</p>

<p>"What shall I call you?" she asked. "I won't
say Miss Warfield."</p>

<p>"Geoffrey Fox calls me Mistress Anne."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a>[<a href="./images/302.png">302</a>]</span>
"Who is Geoffrey Fox?"</p>

<p>"He writes books, and he is going blind. He
wrote 'Three Souls.'"</p>

<p>Marie-Louise stared. "Oh, do you know him?
I loved his book."</p>

<p>"Would you like to know how he came to write
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Tell me."</p>

<p>"Not now. I must go and dress."</p>

<p>Some instinct told Marie-Louise that argument
would be useless.</p>

<p>"I'll dress, too, and come down. Is Dr. Dicky
going to be at dinner?"</p>

<p>"No. He had to go back at once. He is very
busy."</p>

<p>Marie-Louise slipped out of bed. "Therese," she
called, "come and dress me, after you have shown
Miss Warfield the way."</p>

<p>Anne never forgot the moment of entrance into the
great dining-room. There were just four of them.
Dr. Austin and his wife, herself and Marie-Louise.
But for these four there was a formality transcending
anything in Anne's experience. Carved marble,
tapestry, liveried servants, a massive table with fruit
piled high in a Sheffield basket.</p>

<p>The people were dwarfed by the room. It was as
if the house had been built for giants, and had been
divorced from its original purpose. Anne, walking
with Marie-Louise, wondered whimsically if there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a>[<a href="./images/303.png">303</a>]</span>
were any ceilings or whether the roof touched the
stars.</p>

<p>Mrs. Austin was supported by her husband. She
was a little woman with gray hair. She wore pearls
and silver. Anne was in white. Marie-Louise in
a quaint frock of gold brocade. There seemed to
be no color in the room except the gold of the fire
on the great hearth, the gold of the oranges on the
table, and the gold of Marie-Louise's gown.</p>

<p>Mrs. Austin was pale and silent. But she had
attentive eyes. Anne was uncomfortably possessed
with the idea that the little lady listened and criticized,
or at least that she held her opinion in reserve.</p>

<p>Marie-Louise spoke of Geoffrey Fox. "Miss Warfield
knows him. She knows how he came to write
his book."</p>

<p>Anne told them how he came to write it. Of
Peggy ill at Bower's, of the gray plush pussy cat,
and of how, coming up the hall with the bowl of
soup in her hand, she had found Fox in a despairing
mood and had suggested the plot.</p>

<p>Austin, watching her, decided that she was most
unusual. She was beautiful, but there was something
more than beauty. It was as if she was lighted
from within by a fire which gave warmth not only
to herself but to those about her.</p>

<p>He was glad that he had brought her here to be
with Marie-Louise. For the moment even his wife's
pale beauty seemed cold.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a>[<a href="./images/304.png">304</a>]</span>
"We'll have Fox up," he said, when she finished
her story.</p>

<p>Anne was sure that he would be glad to come.
She blushed a little as she said it.</p>

<p>Later, when they were having coffee in the little
drawing-room, Marie-Louise taxed her with the
blush. "Is he in love with you?"</p>

<p>Anne felt it best to be frank. "He thought he
was."</p>

<p>"Don't you love him?"</p>

<p>"No, Marie-Louise. And we mustn't talk about
it. Love is a sacred thing."</p>

<p>"I like to talk about it. In summer I talk to Pan.
But he's out now in the snow and his pipes are
frozen."</p>

<p>The little drawing-room seemed to Anne anything
but little until she learned that there was a larger
one across the hall. Austin and his wife went up-stairs
as soon as the coffee had been served, and
Marie-Louise led Anne through the shadowy vastness
of the great drawing-room to a window which
overlooked the river. "You can't see the river,
but the light over the doorway shines on my old
Pan's head. You can see him grinning out of the
snow."</p>

<p>The effect of that white head peering from the
blackness was uncanny. The shaft of light struck
straight across the peaked chin and twisted mouth.
The snow had made him a cap which covered his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a>[<a href="./images/305.png">305</a>]</span>
horns and which gave him the look of a rakish old
tipster.</p>

<p>"Oh, Marie-Louise, do you talk to him of love?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Wait till you see him in the spring with
the pink roses back of him. He seems to get
younger in the spring."</p>

<p>Anne, going to bed that night in a suite of rooms
which might have belonged to a princess, wondered
if she should wake in the morning and find herself
dreaming. To have her own bath, a silk canopy
over her head, to know that breakfast would be
served when she rang for it, and that her mail and
newspapers would be brought&mdash;these were unbelievable
things. She had a feeling that if she told Uncle
Rod he would shake his head over it. He had a
theory that luxury tended to cramp the soul.</p>

<p>Yet her last thought was not of Uncle Rod but of
Richard. She had come intending to give him a
sharp opinion of his neglect of Nancy. But he had
been so glad to see her, and had given her such a
good time. Yet she had spoken of Nancy's loneliness.</p>

<p>"I hated to leave her," she said, "but it seemed
as if I had to come."</p>

<p>"Of course," he agreed, with his eyes on her glowing
face, "and anyhow, she has Sulie."</p>

<p>Marie-Louise, in the days that followed, found interest
and occupation in showing the Country Mouse
the sights of the city.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a>[<a href="./images/306.png">306</a>]</span>
"If you want to see such things," she said rather
grandly, "I shall be glad to go with you."</p>

<p>Anne insisted that they should not be driven in
state and style. "People make pilgrimages on
foot," she told Marie-Louise gravely, but with a
twinkle in her eye. "I don't want to whirl up to
Grant's tomb, or to the door of Trinity. And I like
the subway and the elevated and the surface cars."</p>

<p>If now and then they compromised on a taxi, it
was because distances were too great at times, and
other means of transportation too slow. But in the
main they stuck to their original plan, and Marie-Louise
entered a new world.</p>

<p>"Oh, I love you for it," she said to Anne one
night when they came home from the Battery after
a day in which they had gazed down into the pit of
the Stock Exchange, had lunched at Faunce's Tavern,
had circled the great Aquarium, and ended with
a ride on top of a Fifth Avenue 'bus in the twilight.</p>

<p>It was from the top of the 'bus that Anne for the
first time since she had come to New York saw
Evelyn Chesley.</p>

<p>She was coming out of a shop with Richard. It
was a great shop with a world-famous name over
the door. One bought furniture there of a rare kind
and draperies of a rare kind and now and then a
picture.</p>

<p>"They are getting things for their apartment,"
Marie-Louise explained, and her words struck cold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a>[<a href="./images/307.png">307</a>]</span>
against Anne's heart. "Eve is paying for them
with Aunt Maude's money."</p>

<p>"When will they be married?"</p>

<p>"Next October. But Eve is buying things as she
sees them. I don't want her to marry Dr. Dicky."</p>

<p>"Why not, Marie-Louise?"</p>

<p>"He isn't her kind. He ought to have fallen in
love with you."</p>

<p>"Marie-Louise, I told you not to talk of love."</p>

<p>"I shall talk of anything I please."</p>

<p>"Then you'll talk to the empty air. I won't
listen. I'll go up there and sit with that fat man in
front."</p>

<p>Marie-Louise laughed. "You're such an old
dear. Do you know how nice you look in those
furs?"</p>

<p>"I feel so elegant that I am ashamed of myself.
I've peeped into every mirror. They cost a whole
month's salary, Marie-Louise. I feel horribly extravagant&mdash;and
happy."</p>

<p>They laughed together, and it was then that
Marie-Louise said, "I love it."</p>

<p>"Love what?"</p>

<p>"Going with you and being young."</p>

<p>In the days that followed Anne found herself
revelling in the elegances of her life, in the excitements.
It was something of an experience to meet
Evelyn Chesley on equal grounds in the little drawing-room.
Anne always took Mrs. Austin's place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a>[<a href="./images/308.png">308</a>]</span>
when there were gatherings of young folks. Marie-Louise
refused to be tied, and came and went as the
spirit moved her. So it was Anne who in something
shimmering and silken moved among the tea guests,
and danced later in slippers as shining as anything
Eve had ever worn.</p>

<p>It was on this day that Geoffrey Fox came and
met Marie-Louise for the first time.</p>

<p>"I can't dance," he told her; "my eyes are bad,
and things seem to whirl."</p>

<p>"If you'll talk," she said, "I'll sit at your feet and
listen."</p>

<p>She did it literally, perched on a small gold stool.</p>

<p>"Tell me about your book," she said, looking up
at him. "Anne Warfield says that you wrote it at
Bower's."</p>

<p>"I wrote it because she helped me to write it.
But she did more for me than that." His eyes were
following the shining figure.</p>

<p>"What did she do?"</p>

<p>"She gave me a soul. She taught me that there
was something in me that was not&mdash;the flesh and
the&mdash;devil."</p>

<p>The girl on the footstool understood. "She believes
in things, and makes you believe."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I hated to have her come," Marie-Louise confessed,
"and now I should hate to have her go
away. She calls herself a country mouse, and I am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a>[<a href="./images/309.png">309</a>]</span>
showing her the sights&mdash;we go to corking places&mdash;on
pilgrimages. We went to Grant's tomb, and she
made me carry a wreath. And we ride in the subway
and drink hot chocolate in drug stores.</p>

<p>"She says I haven't learned the big lessons of
democracy," Marie-Louise pursued, "that I've looked
out over the world, but that I have never been a
part of it. That I've sat on a tower in a garden and
have peered through a telescope."</p>

<p>She told him of the play that she had written, and
of the verses that she had read to the piping Pan.</p>

<p>Later she pointed out Pan to him from the window
of the big drawing-room. The snow had melted in
the last mild days, and there was an icicle on his
nose, and the sun from across the river reddened his
cheeks.</p>

<p>"And there, everlastingly, he makes music,"
Geoffrey said, "'on the reed which he tore from
the river.'"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"&nbsp;'Yes, half a beast is the great god, Pan,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">To laugh as he sits by the river,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">Making a poet out of a man.<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">The true gods sigh for the cost and pain,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">For the reed that grows nevermore again,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">As a reed with the reeds in the river.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His voice died away into silence. "That is the
price which the writer pays. He is separated, as it
were, from his kind."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," Marie-Louise breathed, "oh, no. Not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a>[<a href="./images/310.png">310</a>]</span>
you. Your writings bring you&mdash;close. Your book
made me&mdash;cry."</p>

<p>She was such a child as she stood there, yet with
something in her, too, of womanliness.</p>

<p>"When your three soldiers died," she said, "it
made me believe something that I hadn't believed
before&mdash;about souls marching toward a great&mdash;light."</p>

<p>Geoffrey found himself confiding in her. "I don't
know whether you will understand. But ever since
I wrote that book I have felt that I must live up to
it. That I must be worthy of the thing I had written."</p>

<p>Richard, dancing in the music room with Anne,
found himself saying, "How different it all is."</p>

<p>"From Bower's?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Do you like it?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes. And then sometimes it all seems
so big&mdash;and useless."</p>

<p>The music stopped, and they made their way back
to the little drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Won't you sit here and talk to me?" Richard
said. "Somehow we never seem to find time to
talk."</p>

<p>She smiled. "There is always so much to do."</p>

<p>But she knew that it was not the things to be done
which had kept her from him. It was rather a sense
that safety lay in seeing as little of him as possible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a>[<a href="./images/311.png">311</a>]</span>
And so, throughout the winter she had built about
herself barriers of reserve. Yet there had never been
a moment when he had dined with them, or when
he had danced, or when he had shared their box at
the opera, that she had not been keenly conscious of
his presence.</p>

<p>"And so you think it is all so big&mdash;and useless?"
He picked up the conversation where they had
dropped it when the dance stopped.</p>

<p>She nodded. "A house like this isn't a home. I
told Marie-Louise the other day that a home was a
place where there was a little fire, with somebody
on each side of it, and where there was a little table
with two people smiling across it, and with a pot
boiling and a woman to stir it, and with a light in
the window and a man coming home."</p>

<p>"And what did Marie-Louise say to that?"</p>

<p>"She wrote a poem about it. A nice healthy
sane little poem&mdash;not one of those dreadful things
about the ashes of dead women which I found her
doing when I came."</p>

<p>"How did you cure her?"</p>

<p>"I am giving her real things to think of. When
she gets in a morbid mood I whisk her off to the
gardener's cottage, and we wash and dress the baby
and take him for an airing."</p>

<p>Richard gave a big laugh. "With your head in
the stars, you have your feet always firmly on the
ground."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a>[<a href="./images/312.png">312</a>]</span>
"I try to, but I like to know that there are always&mdash;stars."</p>

<p>"No one could be near you and not know that,"
he told her gravely.</p>

<p>It was a danger signal. She rose. "I have a
feeling that you are neglecting somebody. You
haven't danced yet with Miss Chesley."</p>

<p>"Oh, Eve's all right," easily; "sit down."</p>

<p>But she would not. She sent him from her. His
place was by Eve's side. He was going to marry Eve.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It was late that night when Marie-Louise came
into Anne's room. "Are you asleep?" she asked,
with the door at a crack.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Will you mind&mdash;if I talk?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Anne was in front of her open fire, writing to
Uncle Rod. The fire was another of the luxuries in
which she revelled. It was such a wonder of a fireplace,
with its twinkling brasses, and its purring logs.
She remembered the little round stove in her room
at Bower's.</p>

<p>Marie-Louise had come to talk of Geoffrey Fox.</p>

<p>"I adore his eye-glasses."</p>

<p>"Oh, Marie-Louise&mdash;his poor eyes."</p>

<p>"He isn't poor," the child said, passionately, "not
even his eyes. Milton was blind&mdash;and&mdash;and there
was his poetry."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a>[<a href="./images/313.png">313</a>]</span>
"Dr. Dicky hopes his eyes are getting better."</p>

<p>"He says they are. That he sees things now
through a sort of silver rain. He has to have some
one write for him. His little sister Mimi has been
doing it, but she is going to be married."</p>

<p>"Mimi?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He found out that she had a lover, and so
he has insisted. And then he will be left alone."</p>

<p>She sat gazing into the fire, a small humped-up
figure in a gorgeous dressing-gown. At last she
said, "Why didn't you love him?"</p>

<p>"There was some one else, Marie-Louise."</p>

<p>Marie-Louise drew close and laid her red head on
Anne's knee. "Some one that you are going to
marry?"</p>

<p>Anne shook her head. "Some one whom I shall
never marry. He loves&mdash;another girl, Marie-Louise."</p>

<p>"Oh!" There was a long silence, as the two
of them gazed into the fire. Then Marie-Louise
reached up a thin little hand to Anne's warm clasp.
"That's always the way, isn't it? It is a sort of
game, with Love always flitting away to&mdash;another
girl."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3><i>In Which St. Michael Hears a Call.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was in April that Geoffrey Fox wrote to Anne.</p>

<p>"When I told you that I was coming back to
Bower's, I said that I wanted quiet to think out my
new book, but I did not tell you that I fancied I
might find your ghost flitting through the halls, or
on the road to the schoolhouse. I felt that there
might linger in the long front room the glowing
spirit of the little girl who sat by the fire and talked
to me of my soldiers and their souls.</p>

<p>"And what I thought has come true. You are
everywhere, Mistress Anne, not as I last saw you at
Rose Acres in silken attire, but fluttering before me
in your frock of many flounces, carrying your star
of a lantern through the twilight on your way to
Diogenes, scolding me on the stairs&mdash;&mdash;! What
days, what hours! And always you were the little
school-teacher, showing your wayward scholars what
to do with life!</p>

<p>"Perhaps I have done with it less than you expected.
But at least I have done more with it than
I had hoped. I am lining my pockets with money,
and Mimi has a chest of silver. That is the immediate
material effect of the sale of 'Three Souls.' But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a>[<a href="./images/315.png">315</a>]</span>
there is more than the material effect. The letters
which I get from the people who have read the book
are like wine to my soul. To think that I, Geoffrey
Fox, who have frittered and frivoled, should have
put on paper things which have burned into men's
consciousness and have made them better. I could
never have done it except for you. Yet in all humility
I can say that I have done it, and that never
while life lasts shall I think again of my talent as a
little thing.</p>

<p>"For it is a great thing, Mistress Anne, to have
written a book. In all of my pot-boiling days I
would never have believed it. A plot was a plot,
and presto, the thing was done! The world read
and forgot. But the world doesn't forget. Not
when we give our best, and when we aim to get
below the surface things and the shallow things and
call up out of men's hearts that which, in these practical
days, they try to hide.</p>

<p>"I suppose Brooks has told you about my eyes,
and of how it may happen that I shall, for the rest
of my life, be able to see through a glass darkly.</p>

<p>"That is something to be thankful for, isn't it?
It is a rather weird experience when, having adjusted
one's self in anticipation of a catastrophe, the catastrophe
hangs fire. Like old Pepys, I had resigned
myself to the inevitable&mdash;indeed in those awful waiting
days I read, more than once, the last paragraph
of his diary.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a>[<a href="./images/316.png">316</a>]</span>
"'And so I betake myself to that course which it is
almost as much as to see myself go into my grave;
for which, and all the discomforts that will accompany
my being blind, the good God prepare me!'</p>

<p>"Yet Pepys kept his sight all the rest of his life,
and regretted, I fancy, more than once, that he did
not finish his diary. And, perhaps, I, too, shall be
granted this dim vision until the end.</p>

<p>"It seems to me that there are many things which
I ought to tell you&mdash;I know there are a thousand
things which are forbidden. But at least I can speak
of Diogenes. I saw him at Crossroads the other
day, much puffed up with pride of family. And I
can speak of Mrs. Nancy, who is a white shadow of
herself. Why doesn't Brooks see it? He was down
here for a week recently, and he didn't seem to
realize that anything was wrong. Perhaps she is
always so radiant when he comes that she dazzles
his eyes.</p>

<p>"She and Miss Sulie are a pathetic pair. I meet
them on the road on their errands of mercy. They
are like two sisters of charity in their long capes and
little bonnets. Evidently Mrs. Brooks feels that if
her son cannot doctor the community she can at
least nurse it. The country folks adore her, and go
to her for advice, so that Crossroads still opens wide
its doors to the people, as it did in the days of old
Dr. Brooks.</p>

<p>"And now, does the Princess still serve? I can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a>[<a href="./images/317.png">317</a>]</span>
see you with your blue bowl on your way to Peggy,
and stopping on the stairs to light for me the torch
of inspiration. And now all of this service and inspiration
is being spilled at the feet of&mdash;Marie-Louise!
Will you give her greetings, and ask her how soon I
may come and worship at the shrine of her grinning
old god?"</p>

<p>Anne, carrying his letter to Marie-Louise, asked,
"Shall I tell him to come?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I didn't want him to go away, but he said
he must&mdash;that he couldn't write here. But I knew
why he went, and you knew."</p>

<p>"You needn't look at me so reproachfully, Marie-Louise.
It isn't my fault."</p>

<p>"It is your fault," Marie-Louise accused her, "for
being like a flame. Father says that people hold
out their hands to you as they do to a fire."</p>

<p>"And what," Anne demanded, "has all this to do
with Geoffrey Fox?"</p>

<p>"You know," Marie-Louise told her bluntly, "he
loves you and looks up to you&mdash;and I&mdash;sit at his
feet."</p>

<p>There was something of tenseness in the small face
framed by the red hair. Anne touched Marie-Louise's
cheek with a tender finger. "Dear heart,"
she said, "he is just a man."</p>

<p>For a moment the child stood very still, then she
said, "Is he? Or is he a god, like my Pan in the
garden?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a>[<a href="./images/318.png">318</a>]</span>
Later she decided that Geoffrey should come in
May. "When there are roses. And I'll have some
people out."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It was in May that Rose Acres justified its name.
The marble Pan piping on his reeds faced a garden
abloom with beauty. At the right, a grass walk led
down to a sunken fountain approached by wide stone
steps.</p>

<p>It was on these steps that Marie-Louise sat one
morning, weaving a garland.</p>

<p>"I am going to tie it with gold ribbon," she said.
"Tibbs got the laurel for me."</p>

<p>"Who is it for?"</p>

<p>"It may be for&mdash;Pan," Marie-Louise wore an air
of mystery, "and it may not."</p>

<p>She stuck it later on Pan's head, but the effect did
not please her. "You are nothing but a grinning
old marble doll," she told him, and Anne laughed at
her.</p>

<p>"I hoped some day you'd find that out."</p>

<p>Richard, arriving late that afternoon, found Mrs.
Austin on the terrace. "The young people are in
the garden," she said; "will you hunt them up?"</p>

<p>"I want to talk to Dr. Austin, if I may."</p>

<p>"He's in the house. He was called to the telephone."</p>

<p>Austin, coming out, found his young assistant on
the portico.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a>[<a href="./images/319.png">319</a>]</span>
"Can you give me a second, sir? I've a letter
from mother. There's a lot of sickness at Crossroads.
And I feel responsible."</p>

<p>"Why should you feel responsible?"</p>

<p>"It's the water supply. Typhoid. If I had been
there I should have had it looked into. I had started
an investigation but there was no one to push it.
And now there are a dozen cases. Eric Brand's little
wife, Beulah, and old Peter Bower, and the mother
of little Fran&ccedil;ois."</p>

<p>"And you are thinking that you ought to go
down?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I don't see how I can let you go. It doesn't
make much difference where people are sick, Brooks,
there's always so much for us doctors to do."</p>

<p>"But if I could be spared&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can't, Brooks. I am sorry. But I've learned
to depend on you."</p>

<p>The older man laid his hand affectionately on the
shoulder of the younger. If for the moment Richard
felt beneath the softness of that touch the iron glove
of one who expected obedience from a subordinate,
he did not show it by word or glance.</p>

<p>They talked of other things after that, and presently
Richard wandered off to find Eve. He passed
beyond the terraces to the garden. He felt tired and
depressed. The fragrance of the roses was heavy
and almost overpowering. There was a stone bench<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a>[<a href="./images/320.png">320</a>]</span>
set in the midst of a tangle of bloom. He sank down
on it, asking nothing better than to sit there alone
and think it out.</p>

<p>He felt at this moment, strongly, what had come
to him many times during the winter&mdash;that he was
not in any sense his own master. Austin directed,
controlled, commanded. For the opportunity which
he had given young Brooks he expected the return
of acquiescence. Thus it happened that Richard
found less of big things and more of little ones in his
life than he had anticipated. There had been times
when the moral side of a case had appealed to him
more than the medical, when he had been moved by
generosities such as had moved his grandfather,
when he had wanted to be human rather than professional,
and always he had found Austin blocking
his idealistic impulses, scoffing at the things he had
valued, imposing upon him a somewhat hard philosophy
in the place of a living faith. It seemed to
Richard that in his profession, as well as in his love
affair, he was no longer meeting life with a direct
glance.</p>

<p>He rose and went on. He must find Eve. He
had promised and yet in that moment he knew that
he did not want to see her. He wanted his mother's
touch, her understanding, her love. He wanted
Crossroads and big Ben&mdash;and the people who,
because of his grandfather, had called him&mdash;"friend."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a>[<a href="./images/321.png">321</a>]</span>
He found Anne and Geoffrey and Marie-Louise
by the fountain at the end of the grass walk. Marie-Louise
perched on the rim was, in her pale green
gown, like some nymph freshly risen. Her hat was
off, and her red hair caught the sunlight.</p>

<p>Anne was reading the first chapter of Geoffrey's
new book. He sat just above her on the steps of
the fountain. His glasses were off, and as he looked
down at her his eyes showed a brilliancy which
seemed to contradict his failing sight.</p>

<p>Marie-Louise held up a warning finger. "Sit
down," she said, "and listen. It is such a wonder-book,
Dr. Dicky."</p>

<p>So Richard sat down and Anne went on reading.
She read well; her voice had a thrilling quality, and
once it broke.</p>

<p>"Oh, why did you make it so sad?" she said.</p>

<p>"Could I make it glad?" he asked, and to
Richard, watching, there came the jealous certainty
that between the two of them there was some subtle
understanding.</p>

<p>When at last Anne had read all that he had
written Marie-Louise said, importantly, "Anne is
the heroine, the Princess who serves. Will you ever
make me the heroine of a book, Geoffrey Fox?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps. Give me a plot?"</p>

<p>"Have a girl who loves a marble god&mdash;then some
day she meets a man&mdash;and the god is afraid he will
lose her, so he wakes to life and says, 'If you love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a>[<a href="./images/322.png">322</a>]</span>
this man, you will have to accept the common lot of
women, you will have to work for him and obey him&mdash;and
some day he will die and your soul will be
rent with sorrow. But if you love me, I shall be
here when you are forgotten, and while you live my
love will demand nothing but the verses that you
read to me and the roses that lay at my feet.'"</p>

<p>Geoffrey gave her an eager glance. "Jove,
there's more in that than a joke. Some day I shall
get you to amplify your idea."</p>

<p>"I'll give it to you if you promise to write the
book here. There's a balcony room that overlooks
the river&mdash;and nobody would ever interrupt you but
me, and I'd only come when you wanted me."</p>

<p>Marie-Louise's breath was short as she finished.
To cover her emotion she caught up the wreath
which she had made in the morning, and which lay
beside her.</p>

<p>"I made it for you," she told Geoffrey, "and now
that I've done it, I don't know what to do with it."</p>

<p>She was blushing and glowing, less of an imp
and more of a girl than Richard had ever seen her.</p>

<p>Geoffrey rose to the occasion. "It shall be a
mascot for my new book. I'll hang it on the wall
over my desk, and every time I look up at it, it shall
say to me, 'These are the laurels you are to win.'"</p>

<p>"You have won them," Marie-Louise flashed.</p>

<p>"No artist ever feels himself worthy of laurel.
His achievement always falls short of his ambition."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a>[<a href="./images/323.png">323</a>]</span>
"But 'Three Souls,'" Marie-Louise said; "surely
you were satisfied?"</p>

<p>"I did not write it&mdash;the credit belongs to Mistress
Anne. Your wreath should be hers."</p>

<p>But Marie-Louise's mind was made up. Before
Geoffrey could grasp what she was about to do, she
fluttered up the steps, and dropped the garland
lightly on his dark locks.</p>

<p>It became him well.</p>

<p>"Do you like it?" he asked Anne.</p>

<p>"To the Victor&mdash;the spoils," she told him, smiling.</p>

<p>Richard felt out of it. He wanted to get away,
and he knew that he must find Eve. Eve, who
when he met her would laugh her light laugh, and
call him "Dicky Boy," and refuse to listen when he
spoke of Crossroads.</p>

<p>The path that he took led to a little tea house
built on the bank, which gave a wide view of the
river and the Jersey hills. He found Winifred and
Tony side by side and silent.</p>

<p>"Better late than never," was Tony's greeting.</p>

<p>"I am hunting for Eve."</p>

<p>"She and Meade were here a moment ago,"
Winifred informed him. "Sit down and give an
account of yourself. We haven't seen you in a
million years."</p>

<p>"Just a week, dear lady. I have been horribly
busy."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a>[<a href="./images/324.png">324</a>]</span>
"You say that as if you meant the 'horribly.'"</p>

<p>"I do. It has been a 'bluggy' business, and I
am tired." He laughed with a certain amount of
constraint. "If I were a boy, I should say 'I want
to go home.'"</p>

<p>Winifred gave him a quick glance. "What has
happened?"</p>

<p>"Oh, everybody is ill at Crossroads. Beastly
conditions. And they ought to have been corrected.
Beulah's ill."</p>

<p>"The little bride?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And Eric is frantic. He has written me,
asking me to come down. But Austin can't see it."</p>

<p>"Could you go for the day?"</p>

<p>"If I went for a day I should stay longer. There's
everything to be done."</p>

<p>He switched away from the subject. "Crowd
seems to have separated. Fox and Anne Warfield
by the fountain. You and Tony here, and Eve and
Pip as yet undiscovered."</p>

<p>"It is the day," Winifred decided, "all romance
and roses. Even Tony and I were a-lovering when
Eve found us."</p>

<p>Richard rose. "Tony, she wants to hold your
hand. I'll get out."</p>

<p>Winifred laughed. "You'd better go and hold
Eve's."</p>

<p>As he went away, Richard wondered if there was
anything significant in her way of saying it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a>[<a href="./images/325.png">325</a>]</span>
Eve and Pip were in the enclosed space where
Pan gleamed white against the dark cedars. Eve
was seated on the sun-dial. Pip had lifted her there,
and he stood leaning against it. Her lap was full of
roses, and there were roses on her hat. The high
note of color was repeated in the pink sunshade
which lay open where the wind had wafted it to the
feet of the piping Pan.</p>

<p>Pip straightened up as he saw Richard approaching.
"There comes your eager lover, Eve. Give
me a rose before he gets here."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"Of me?"</p>

<p>"No. But if I give you anything you'll take
more. And I want to give everything to&mdash;Dicky."</p>

<p>He laughed a triumphant laugh. "I take all <i>I</i>
can get. Give me a rose, Eve."</p>

<p>She yielded to his masterfulness. Out of the mass
of bloom she chose a pink bud. "I shall give a red
one to Dicky, so don't feel puffed up."</p>

<p>"I told you I should take what I could get, and
Brooks isn't thinking of roses. Look at his face."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to be so late, Eve," Richard said, as
he came up. "I am always apologizing, it seems
to me."</p>

<p>"Little Boy Blue&mdash;&mdash;! Dicky, what's the matter?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a>[<a href="./images/326.png">326</a>]</span>
"I want to go home." He tried to speak lightly&mdash;to
follow her mood.</p>

<p>"Home&mdash;to Crossroads?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"There's typhoid, and they don't know how to
cope with it."</p>

<p>"Aren't there other doctors?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but not enough."</p>

<p>"Nonsense; what did they do before you came to
the county? You must get rid of the feeling that
you are so&mdash;important." She was angry. Little
sparks were in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Eve. Austin doesn't want me to
go. I can't get away. But it is on my mind."</p>

<p>"Put it off and come and help me with my roses.
I gave Pip a bud. Are you jealous, Dicky?"</p>

<p>Still trying to follow her mood, he said, "You
and the rest of the roses belong to me. Why should
I care for one poor bud?"</p>

<p>She stuck a red rose in his coat, and when she had
made her flowers into a nosegay, he lifted her down
from the sun-dial. For a moment she clung to him.
Meade had gone to rescue the sunshade which was
blowing down the slope, and for the moment they
were alone. "Dicky," she whispered, "I was horrid,
but you mustn't go."</p>

<p>"I told you I couldn't, Eve."</p>

<p>Then Pip came back, and the three of them made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a>[<a href="./images/327.png">327</a>]</span>
their way to the fountain, picking up Winifred and
Tony as they passed. Tea was served on the terrace,
and a lot of other people motored out. There was
much laughter and lightness&mdash;as if there were no
trouble in the whole wide world.</p>

<p>Richard felt separated from it all by his mood,
and when he went to the house to send a message
for Austin to the hospital, he did not at once return
to the terrace. He sought the great library. It was
dim and quiet and he lay back in one of the big
chairs and shut his eyes. The vision was before
him of Pip leaning on the sun-dial against a rose-splashed
background, with Eve smiling down at
him. It had come to him then that Pip should have
married Eve. Pip would make her happy. The
thing was all wrong in some way, but he could not
see clearly how to make it right.</p>

<p>There was a sound in the room and he opened his
eyes to find Marie-Louise on the ladder which gave
access to the shelves of the great bookcases which
lined the walls. She had not seen him, and she
was singing softly to herself. In the dimness the
color of her hair and gown gave a stained-glass
effect against a background of high square east window.</p>

<p>Richard sat up. What was she singing?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>I think she was the most beautiful lady</i><br /></span>
<span class="ihalf"><i>That ever was in the West Country,</i><br /></span>
<span class="ihalf"><i>But beauty vanishes, beauty passes,</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a>[<a href="./images/328.png">328</a>]</span><br /></span>
<span class="ihalf"><i>However rare, rare it be.</i><br /></span>
<span class="ihalf"><i>And when I am gone, who shall remember</i><br /></span>
<span class="ihalf"><i>That lady of the West Country?</i>&nbsp;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Marie-Louise," he asked so suddenly that she
nearly fell off of the shelves, "where did you learn
that song?"</p>

<p>"From Mistress Anne."</p>

<p>"When you sing it do you think of&mdash;her?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Marie-Louise sat down on the top step of the ladder.
"Dr. Dicky, may I ask a question?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you fall in love with Anne?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Oh! Then why didn't you marry her?"</p>

<p>"She is going to marry Geoffrey Fox."</p>

<p>Dead silence. Then, "Did she tell you?"</p>

<p>"No. He told me. Last spring."</p>

<p>"Before you came here?"</p>

<p>"Yes. That was the reason I came. I wanted to
get away from everything that&mdash;spoke of her."</p>

<p>Marie-Louise slipped down from the ladder and
came and stood beside him. "<i>He told you</i>," she
said in a sharp whisper, "but there must be some
mistake. She doesn't love him. She said that she
didn't. I wonder why he lied."</p>

<p>There was nothing cold about her now. She was
a fiery spark. "Only a&mdash;<i>cad</i> could do such a thing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a>[<a href="./images/329.png">329</a>]</span>&mdash;and
I thought&mdash;oh, Dr. Dicky, I thought he was
a <i>man</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She flung herself at his feet like a stricken child.
He went down to her. "Marie-Louise, stop. Sit
up and tell me what's the matter."</p>

<p>She sat up. "I shall ask Anne. I shall go and
get her and ask her."</p>

<p>He found himself calling after her, "Marie-Louise,"
but she was gone.</p>

<p>She came back presently, dragging the protesting
Anne. "But Marie-Louise, what do you want of
me?"</p>

<p>Richard, rising, said, "Please don't think I permitted
this. I tried to stop her."</p>

<p>"I didn't want to be stopped," Marie-Louise told
them. "I want to know whether you and Geoffrey
Fox are going to be married."</p>

<p>Anne's cheeks were stained red. "Of course not.
But it isn't anything to get so excited about, is it,
Marie-Louise?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is. He told Dr. Dicky that you were, and
he <i>lied</i>. And I thought, oh, you know the wonderful
things I thought about him, Mistress Anne."</p>

<p>Anne's arm went around the sad little nymph in
green. "You must still think wonderful things of
him. He was very unhappy, and desperate about
his eyes. And it seemed to him that to assert a
thing might make it come true."</p>

<p>"But you didn't love him?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a>[<a href="./images/330.png">330</a>]</span>
"Never, Marie-Louise."</p>

<p>And now Richard, ignoring the presence of Marie-Louise,
ignoring everything but the question which
beat against his heart, demanded:</p>

<p>"If you knew that he had told me this, why didn't
you make things clear?"</p>

<p>"When I might have made things clear&mdash;you
were engaged to Eve."</p>

<p>She turned abruptly from him to Marie-Louise.
"Run back to your poet, dear heart. He is waiting
for the book that you were going to bring him. And
remember that you are not to sit in judgment. You
are to be eyes for him, and light."</p>

<p>It was a sober little nymph in green who marched
away with her book. Geoffrey sat on the stone
bench a little withdrawn from the others. His lean
face, straining toward the house, relaxed as she
came within his line of vision.</p>

<p>"You were a long time away," he said, and made
a place for her beside him, and she sat down and
opened her book.</p>

<p>And now, back in the dim library, Anne and
Richard!</p>

<p>"I stayed," she said, "because they were speaking
out there of Crossroads. I have had a letter, too,
from Sulie. She says that the situation is desperate."</p>

<p>"Yes. They need me. And I ought to go.
They are my people. I feel that in a sense I belong
to them&mdash;as my grandfather belonged."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a>[<a href="./images/331.png">331</a>]</span>
"Do you mean that if you go now you will
stay?"</p>

<p>"I am not sure. The future must take care of itself."</p>

<p>"Your mother would be glad if your decision
finally came to that."</p>

<p>"Yes. And I should be glad. But this time I
shall not go for my mother's sake alone. Something
deeper is drawing me. I can't quite analyze
it. It is a call"&mdash;he laughed a little&mdash;"such as men
describe who enter the ministry,&mdash;an irresistible impulse,
as if I were to find something there that I had
lost in the city."</p>

<p>She held out her hand to him. "Do you know
the name I had for you when you were at Crossroads?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I called you St. Michael&mdash;because it always
seemed to me that you carried a sword."</p>

<p>He tightened his grip on the little hand. "Some
day I shall hope to justify the name; I don't deserve
it now."</p>

<p>Her eyes came up to him. "You'll fight to win,"
she said, softly.</p>

<p>He did not want to let her go. But there was no
other way. But when she had joined the others on
the terrace he made a wide detour of the garden,
and wandered down to the river.</p>

<p>It was not a singing river, but to-day it seemed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"></a>[<a href="./images/332.png">332</a>]</span>
have a song, "<i>Go back, go back</i>," it said; "<i>you have
seen the world, you have seen the world</i>."</p>

<p>And when he had listened for a little while he
climbed the hill to tell Austin and to tell&mdash;Eve.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3><i>In Which Anne Weighs the People of Two Worlds.</i></h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Richard!</span>"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, I'm here. Austin thinks I
am crazy, and Eve won't speak to me. But&mdash;I
came. And to think you have turned the house
into a hospital!"</p>

<p>"It seemed the only thing to do. Fran&ccedil;ois'
mother had no one to take care of her&mdash;and there
were others, and the house is big."</p>

<p>"You are the biggest thing in it. Mother, if I
ever pray to a saint, it will be one with gray hair in
a nurse's cap and apron, and with shining eyes."</p>

<p>"They are shining because you are here, Richard."</p>

<p>Cousin Sulie, in the door, broke down and cried,
"Oh, we've prayed for it."</p>

<p>They clung to him, the two little growing-old
women, who had wanted him, and who had worked
without him.</p>

<p>He had no words for them, for he could not speak
with steadiness. But in that moment he knew that
he should never go back to Austin. That he should
live and die in the home of his fathers. And that
his work was here.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a>[<a href="./images/334.png">334</a>]</span>
He tried, a little later, to make a joke of their devotion.
"Mother, you and Cousin Sulie mustn't.
I shall need a body-guard to protect me. You'll
spoil me with softness and ease."</p>

<p>"I shall buckle on your armor soon enough," she
told him. "Did Eric meet you at the station?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall go straight to Beulah's. I stopped
in to see old Peter before I came up. I can pull him
through, but I shall have to have some nurses."</p>

<p>And now big Ben, at an even trot, carried Richard
to the Playhouse. Toby, mad with gladness at the
return of his master, raced ahead.</p>

<p>Up in the pretty pink and white room lay Beulah.
No longer plump and blooming, but wasted and wan
with dry lips and hollow eyes.</p>

<p>Eric had said to Richard, "If she dies I shall
die, too."</p>

<p>"She is not going to die."</p>

<p>And now he said it again, cheerfully, to the wasted
figure in the bed. "I have come to make you well,
Beulah."</p>

<p>But Beulah was not at all sure that she wanted to
be&mdash;well. She was too tired. She was tired of Eric,
tired of her mother, tired of taking medicine, tired
of having to breathe.</p>

<p>So she shut her eyes and turned away.</p>

<p>Eric sat by the bed. "Dear heart," he said, "it
is Dr. Dicky."</p>

<p>But she did not open her eyes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a>[<a href="./images/335.png">335</a>]</span>
In the days that followed Richard fought to make
his words come true. He felt that if Beulah died it
would, in some way, be his fault. He was aware
that this was a morbid state of mind, but he could
not help the way he felt. Beulah's life would be the
price of his self-respect.</p>

<p>But it was not only for Beulah's life that he fought,
but for the lives of others. He had nurses up from
Baltimore and down from New York. He had experts
to examine wells and springs and other sources
of water supply. He had a motor car that he might
cover the miles quickly, using old Ben only for short
distances. Toby, adapting himself to the car, sat on
the front seat with the wind in his face, drunk with
the excitement of it.</p>

<p>When Nancy spoke of the expense to which Richard
was putting himself, he said, "I have saved
something, mother, and Eric and the rest can pay."</p>

<p>Surely in those days St. Michael needed his sword,
for the fight was to the finish. Night and day the
battle waged. Richard went from bedside to bedside,
coming always last to Beulah in the shadowed
pink and white room at the Playhouse.</p>

<p>There were nurses now, but Eric Brand would not
be turned out. "Every minute that I am away from
her," he told Richard, "I'm afraid. It seems as if
when I am in sight of her I can hold her&mdash;back."</p>

<p>So, night after night, Richard found him in the
chair by Beulah's bed, his face shaded by his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a>[<a href="./images/336.png">336</a>]</span>
hand, rousing only when Beulah stirred, to smile at
her.</p>

<p>But Beulah did not smile back. She moaned a
little now and then, and sometimes talked of things
that never were on sea or land. There was a flowered
chintz screen in the corner of the room and she
peopled it with strange creatures, and murmured of
them now and then, until the nurse covered the
screen with a white sheet, which seemed to blot it
out of Beulah's mind forever.</p>

<p>There was always a pot of coffee boiling in the
kitchen for the young doctor, and Eric would go
down with him and they would drink and talk, and
all that Eric said led back to Beulah.</p>

<p>"If there was only something that I could do for
her," he said; "if I could go out and work until I
dropped, I should feel as if I were helping. But just
to sit there and see her&mdash;fade."</p>

<p>Again he said, "I had always thought of our living&mdash;never
of dying. There can be no future for
me without her."</p>

<p>So it was for Eric's future as well as for Beulah's
life that Richard strove. He grew worn and weary,
but he never gave up.</p>

<p>Night after night, day after day, from house to
house he went, along the two roads and up into the
hills. Everywhere he met an anxious welcome.
Where the conditions were unfavorable, he transferred
the patient to Crossroads, where Nancy and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337"></a>[<a href="./images/337.png">337</a>]</span>
Sulie and Milly and a trio of nurses formed an enthusiastic
hospital staff.</p>

<p>The mother of little Fran&ccedil;ois was the first patient
that Richard lost. She was tired and overworked,
and she felt that it was good to fall asleep. Afterward
Richard, with the little boy in his arms, went
out and sat where they could look over the river
and talk together.</p>

<p>"I told her that you were to stay with me, Fran&ccedil;ois."</p>

<p>"And she was glad?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I need a little lad in my office, and when
I take the car you can ride with me."</p>

<p>And thus it came about that little Fran&ccedil;ois, a
sober little Fran&ccedil;ois, with a band of black about his
arm, became one of the Crossroads household, and
was made much of by the women, even by black
Milly, who baked cookies for him and tarts whenever
he cried for his mother.</p>

<p>Cousin Sulie rose nobly to meet the new demands
upon her. "It is a feeling I never had before," she
said to Richard, as she helped him pack his bag before
going on his rounds, "that what I am doing is
worth while. I know I should have felt it when I
was darning stockings, but I didn't."</p>

<p>She gloried in the professional aspect which she
gave to everything. She installed little Fran&ccedil;ois at
a small table in the Garden Room. He answered
the telephone and wrote the messages on slips of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a>[<a href="./images/338.png">338</a>]</span>
paper which he laid on the doctor's desk. Cousin
Sulie at another table saw the people who came in
Richard's absence.</p>

<p>"Nancy can read to the patients up-stairs and cut
flowers for them and cook nice things for them,"
she confided, "but I like to be down here when the
children come in to ask for medicine, and when the
mothers come to find out what they shall feed the
convalescents. Richard, I never heard anything
like their&mdash;hungriness&mdash;when they are getting well."</p>

<p>Beulah, emerging slowly from among the shadows,
began to think of things to eat. She didn't
care about anything else. She didn't care for Eric's
love, or her mother's gladness, or Richard's cheerfulness,
or the nurses' sympathy. She cared only
to think of every kind of food that she had ever
liked in her whole life, and to ask if she might
have it.</p>

<p>"But, dear heart, the doctor doesn't think that
you should," Eric would protest.</p>

<p>She would cry, weakly, "You don't love me, or
you would let me."</p>

<p>She begged and begged, and at last he couldn't
stand it.</p>

<p>"You are starving her," he told the nurses fiercely.</p>

<p>They referred him to the doctor.</p>

<p>Eric telephoned Richard.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," was the response, "her appetite
is a sign that she is getting well."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"></a>[<a href="./images/339.png">339</a>]</span>
"But she is so hungry."</p>

<p>"So are they all. I have to steel my heart against
them, especially the children. And half of the convalescents
are reading cook books."</p>

<p>"Cook books!"</p>

<p>"Yes. In that way they get a meal by proxy. I
tell them to pick out the things they are going to
have when they are well enough to eat all they want.
Their choice ranges from Welsh rarebits to plum
puddings."</p>

<p>He laughed, but Eric saw nothing funny in the
matter. "I can't bear to see her&mdash;suffer."</p>

<p>Richard was sobered at once. "Don't think that
I am not sympathetic. But&mdash;Brand, I don't dare-<i>feel</i>.
If I did, I should go to pieces."</p>

<p>Slowly the weeks passed. Besides Fran&ccedil;ois'
mother, two of Richard's patients died. Slowly the
pendulum of time swung the rest of the sick ones
toward recovery. Nancy and Sulie and Milly
changed the rooms at Crossroads back to their original
uses. The nurses, no longer needed, packed
their competent bags, and departed. Beulah at the
Playhouse had her first square meal, and smiled back
at Eric.</p>

<p>The strain had told fearfully on Richard. Yet he
persisted in his efforts long after it seemed that the
countryside was safe. He tried to pack into twelve
short weeks what he would normally have done in
twelve long months. He spurred his fellow physi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340"></a>[<a href="./images/340.png">340</a>]</span>cians
to increased activities, he urged authorities to
unprecedented exertions. He did the work of two
men and sometimes of three. And he was so exhausted
that he felt that if ever his work was finished
he would sleep for a million years.</p>

<p>It was in September that he began to wonder how
he would square things up with Eve. At first she
had written to him blaming him for his desertion.
But not for a moment did she take it seriously.
"You'll be coming back, Dicky," was the burden of
her song. He wrote hurried pleasant letters which
were to some extent bulletins of the day's work. If
Eve was not satisfied she consoled herself with the
thought that he was tearingly busy and terribly
tired.</p>

<p>In her last letter she had said, "Austin doesn't
know what to do without you. He told Pip that you
were his right hand."</p>

<p>Austin had said more than that to Anne. He had
found her one hot day by the fountain. Nancy had
written to her of the death of Fran&ccedil;ois' mother. The
letter was in her hand.</p>

<p>Austin had also had a letter. "Brooks is a fool.
He writes that he is going to stay."</p>

<p>Anne shook her head. "He is not a fool," she
said; "he is doing what he <i>had</i> to do. You would
know if you had ever lived at Crossroads. Why,
the Brooks family belongs there, and the Brooks
doctors."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a>[<a href="./images/341.png">341</a>]</span>
"So you have encouraged him?" Austin said.</p>

<p>"I have had nothing to do with it. I haven't
heard from him since he left, and I haven't written."</p>

<p>"And you think he is&mdash;right to&mdash;bury&mdash;himself?"</p>

<p>Anne sat very still, her hands folded quietly. Her
calm eyes were on the golden fish which swam in
the waters at the base of the fountain.</p>

<p>"I am not sure," she said; "it all has so much
to do with&mdash;old traditions&mdash;and inherited feelings&mdash;and
ideals. He could be just as useful here, but he
would never be happy. You can't imagine how they
look up to him down there. And here he looked up
to you."</p>

<p>"Then you think I didn't give him a free hand?"</p>

<p>"No. But there he is a Brooks of Crossroads.
And it isn't because he wants the honor of it that he
has gone back, but because the responsibility rests
upon him to make the community all that it ought
to be. And he can't shirk it."</p>

<p>"Eve Chesley says that he is tied to his mother's
apron strings."</p>

<p>"She doesn't understand, I do. I sometimes
feel that way about the Crossroads school&mdash;as if I
had shirked something to have&mdash;a good time."</p>

<p>"But you have had a good time."</p>

<p>"Yes, you have all been wonderful to me," her
smile warmed him, "but you won't think that I am
ungrateful when I say that there was something in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a>[<a href="./images/342.png">342</a>]</span>
my life in the little school which carried me&mdash;higher&mdash;than
this."</p>

<p>"Higher? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I was a leader down there. And a force. The
children looked to me for something that I could
give and which the teacher they have isn't giving.
She just teaches books, and I tried to teach them
something of life, and love of country, and love of
God."</p>

<p>"But here you have Marie-Louise, and you know
how grateful we are for what you have done for her."</p>

<p>"I have only developed what was in her. What
a flaming little genius she is!"</p>

<p>"With a poem accepted by an important magazine,
and Fox believing that she can write more of
them."</p>

<p>Anne spoke quietly: "And now I am really not
needed. Marie-Louise can go on alone."</p>

<p>He stopped her. "We want you to stay&mdash;my
wife wants you&mdash;Marie-Louise can't do without you.
And I want you to get Brooks back."</p>

<p>She looked her amazement. "Get him back?"</p>

<p>"He will come if you ask it. I am not blind.
Eve Chesley is. The things she says make him
stubborn. But you could call him back. You could
call to life anything in any man if you willed it.
You are inspirational&mdash;a star to light the way."</p>

<p>His voice was shaken. After a pause he went on:
"Will you help me to get Brooks back?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"></a>[<a href="./images/343.png">343</a>]</span>
She shook her head. "I shall not try. He is
among his own people. He has found his place."</p>

<p>Yet now that Richard was gone, Anne found herself
missing him more than she dared admit. She
was, for the first time, aware that the knowledge that
she should see him now and then had kept her from
loneliness which might otherwise have assailed her.
The thought that she might meet him had added
zest to her engagements. His week-ends at Rose
Acres had been the goal toward which her thoughts
had raced.</p>

<p>And now the great house was empty because of
his absence. The city was empty&mdash;because he had
left it&mdash;forever. She had no hope that he would
come back. Crossroads had claimed him. He had,
indeed, come into his own.</p>

<p>When the rest of his friends spoke of him, praised
or blamed, she was silent. Geoffrey Fox, who came
often, complained, "You are always sitting off in a
corner somewhere with your work, putting in a
million stitches, when I want you to talk."</p>

<p>"You can talk to Marie-Louise. She is your
ardent disciple. She burns candles at your altar."</p>

<p>"She is a charming&mdash;child."</p>

<p>"She is more than that. When her poem was
accepted she cried over the letter. She thinks that
she couldn't have done it except for your help and
criticism."</p>

<p>"She will do more than she has done."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"></a>[<a href="./images/344.png">344</a>]</span>
When Marie-Louise joined them, Anne was glad
to see Geoffrey's protective manner, as if he wanted
to be nice to the child who had cried.</p>

<p>She had to listen to much criticism of Richard.
When Eve and the Dutton-Ames dined one night in
the early fall at Rose Acres, Richard's quixotic
action formed the theme of their discourse.</p>

<p>Eve was very frank. "Somebody ought to tie
Dicky down. His head is in the clouds."</p>

<p>Marie-Louise flashed: "I like people whose heads
are in the clouds. He is doing a wonderful thing
and a wise thing&mdash;and we are all acting as if it were
silly."</p>

<p>Anne wanted to hug Marie-Louise, and with
heightened color she listened to Winifred's defense.</p>

<p>"I think we should all like to feel that we are
equal to it&mdash;to give up money and fame&mdash;for the
thing that&mdash;called."</p>

<p>"There is no better or bigger work for him there
than here," Austin proclaimed.</p>

<p>"No," Winifred agreed, and her eyes were bright,
"but it is because he is giving up something which
the rest of us value that I like him. Renunciation
isn't fashionable, but it is stimulating."</p>

<p>"The usual process is to 'grab and git,'" her
husband sustained her. "We always like to see
some one who isn't bitten by the modern bacillus."</p>

<p>After dinner Anne left them and made her way
down in the darkness to the river. The evening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a>[<a href="./images/345.png">345</a>]</span>
boat was coming up, starred with lights, its big
search-light sweeping the shores. When it passed,
the darkness seemed deeper. The night was cool,
and Anne, wrapped in a white cloak, was like a
ghost among the shadows. Far up on the terrace
she could see the big house, and hear the laughter.
She felt much alone. Those people were not her
people. Her people were of Nancy's kind, well-born
and well bred, but not smart in the modern sense.
They were quiet folk, liking their homes, their friends,
their neighbors. They were not so rich that they
were separated by their money from those about
them. They had time to read and to think. They
were perhaps no better than the people in the big
house on top of the terrace, but they lived at a more
leisurely pace, and it seemed to her at this moment
that they got more out of life.</p>

<p>She wanted more than anything in the world to
be to-night with that little group at Crossroads, to
meet Cousin Sulie's sparkling glance, to sit at Nancy's
knee, to hear Richard's big laugh, as he came in and
found the women waiting for the news of the outside
world that he would bring.</p>

<p>She knew that she could have the little school if
she asked for it. But a sense of dignity restrained
her. She could not go back now. It would seem
to the world that she had followed Richard. Well,
her heart followed him, but the world did not know
that.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a>[<a href="./images/346.png">346</a>]</span>
She heard voices. Geoffrey and Marie-Louise
were at the river's edge.</p>

<p>"It is as if there were just the two of us in
the whole wide world," Marie-Louise was saying.
"That's what I like about the darkness. It seems to
shut everybody out."</p>

<p>"But suppose the darkness followed you into the
day," Geoffrey said, "suppose that for you there
were no light?"</p>

<p>A rim of gold showed above the blackness of the
Jersey hills.</p>

<p>"Oh," Marie-Louise exulted, "look at the moon.
In a moment there will be light, and you thought
you were in the dark."</p>

<p>"You mean that it is an omen?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What a small and comfortable person you are,"
Geoffrey said, and now Anne could see the two of
them silhouetted against the brightening sky, one
tall and slim, the other slim and short. They walked
on, and she heard their voices faintly.</p>

<p>"Do I really make you comfortable, Geoffrey
Fox?"</p>

<p>"You make me more than that, Marie-Louise."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3><i>In Which Richard Rides Alone.</i></h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Eve.</span>"</p>

<p>"Yes, Pip."</p>

<p>"Can't you see that if he cared Richard would do
the thing that pleased you&mdash;that New York would
be Paradise if you were in it?"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't Crossroads be Paradise to me&mdash;with
him?"</p>

<p>"It couldn't be."</p>

<p>"I am going to make it. I talked it over last
night with Aunt Maude. She's an old dear. And I
shall be the Lady of the Manor. If Dicky won't
come to New York, I'll bring New York down to
him."</p>

<p>"It can't be done. And it's going to fail."</p>

<p>"What is going to fail?"</p>

<p>"Your marriage. If you are mad enough to
marry Brooks."</p>

<p>She mused. "Pip, do you remember the fat
Armenian?"</p>

<p>"At Coney? Yes."</p>

<p>"He said that&mdash;I had reached for something beyond
my grasp. That my fingers would touch it,
but that it would soar always above me."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a>[<a href="./images/348.png">348</a>]</span>
"Sounds as if Brooks were some fat sort of a bird.
I can't think of him as soaring. I should call him
the cock that crowed at Crossroads. Oh, it's all rot,
Eve, this idea that love makes things equal. I went
to the Hippodrome not long ago and saw 'Pinafore.'
Our fathers and mothers raved over it. But that
was a sentimental age, and Gilbert poked fun at
them. He made the simple sailor a captain in the
end, so that Josephine shouldn't wash dishes and
cook smelly things in pots and hang out the family
wash. But your hero balks and won't be turned
into a millionaire. If you were writing a book you
might make it work out to your satisfaction, but you
can't twist life to the happy ending."</p>

<p>"I shall try, Pip."</p>

<p>"In Heaven's name, Eve! It is sheer obstinacy.
If everybody wanted you to marry Brooks, you'd
want to marry me. But because Aunt Maude and
Winifred and I, and a lot of others know that you
shouldn't, you have set your heart on it."</p>

<p>She flashed her eyes at him. "Is it obstinacy,
Pip, I wonder? Do you know I rather think I am
going to like it."</p>

<p>Her letters said something of the sort to Richard.
"I shall love it down there. But you must let me
have my own way with the house and garden.
Don't you think I shall make a charming chatelaine,
Dicky, dear?"</p>

<p>He had a sense of relief in her unexpected acqui<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349"></a>[<a href="./images/349.png">349</a>]</span>escence
in his decision. If she had objected, he
would have felt as if he had turned his back not
only on the work that he hated but on the woman he
had promised to marry. It would have looked that
way to others. Yet no matter how it had looked, he
could not have done differently. The call had been
insistent, and the deeps of his nature been stirred.</p>

<p>He was thinking of it all as one morning in October
he rode to the Playhouse on big Ben to see
Beulah.</p>

<p>Dismounting at the gate, he followed the path
which led to the kitchen. Beulah was not there,
and, searching, he saw her under an old apple tree
at the end of the garden. She wore a checked blue
apron, stiffly starched, and she was holding it up by
the corners. A black cat and three sable kittens
frisked at her feet.</p>

<p>Some one was dropping red apples carefully into
the apron, some one who laughed as he swung himself
down and tipped Beulah's chin up with his hand
and kissed her. Richard felt a lump in his throat.
It was such a homely little scene, but it held a meaning
that love had never held for himself and Eve.</p>

<p>Eric untied Beulah's apron string, and carrying
the apples in this improvised bag, with his arm
about her waist sustaining her, they came down the
walk.</p>

<p>"This is Beulah's pet tree. When she was sick
she asked for apples and apples and apples."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350"></a>[<a href="./images/350.png">350</a>]</span>
Beulah, sinking her little white teeth into a red
one, nodded. "It is perfectly wonderful," she said
when she was able to speak, "how good everything
tastes, and I can't get enough."</p>

<p>Eric pinched her cheek. "Pretty good color, doctor.
We'll have them matching the apples yet."</p>

<p>Richard wanted to ask Eric about the dogs.
"Some of my friends are coming down to-morrow
for the Middlefield hunt."</p>

<p>"If they start old Pete there'll be some sport,"
Eric said.</p>

<p>"I shall be half sorry if they do," Richard told
him. "I am always afraid I shall lose him out of
my garden. He is a part of the place, like the box
hedge and the cedars."</p>

<p>He said it lightly, but he meant it. He had hunting
blood in his veins, and he loved the horses and
the dogs. He loved the cold crisp air, and the excitement
of the chase. But what he did not love
was the hunted animal, doubling on its tracks, pursued,
panting, torn to pieces by the hounds.</p>

<p>"Old Pete deserved to live and die among the
hills," Beulah said. "Is Miss Chesley coming down?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and a lot of others. They will put up at
the club. Mother and Sulie aren't up to entertaining
a crowd."</p>

<p>He wanted Eric's dogs for ducks. Dutton-Ames
and one or two others did not ride to hounds, and
would come to Bower's in the morning.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"></a>[<a href="./images/351.png">351</a>]</span>
As he rode away, he was conscious that as soon
as his back was turned Eric's arm would again be
about Beulah, and Beulah's head would be on Eric's
shoulder. And that he would lift her over the threshold
as they went in.</p>

<p>That afternoon Richard motored over to the Country
Club to welcome Eve. She laughed at his little
car. "I'd rather see you on big Ben than in that."</p>

<p>"Ben can't carry me fast enough."</p>

<p>"Don't expect me to ride in it, Dicky."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Dicky, can you <i>ask</i>?"</p>

<p>Meade's great limousine which had brought them
seemed to stare the little car out of countenance.
But Richard refused to be embarrassed by the contrast.
"She's a snug little craft, and she has carried
me miles. What would Meade's car do on these
roads and in the hills?"</p>

<p>Pip had come up and as the two men stood together
Eve's quick eye contrasted them. There was
no doubt of Richard's shabbiness. His old riding
coat was much the worse for wear. He had on the
wrong kind of hat and the wrong kind of shoes,
and he seemed most aggravatingly not to care.
He was to ride to-morrow one of the horses which
had been sent down from Pip's stables. He hadn't
even a proper mount!</p>

<p>Pip, on the other hand, was perfectly groomed.
He was shining and immaculate from the top of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352"></a>[<a href="./images/352.png">352</a>]</span>
smooth head to the heel of his boots. And he wore
an air of gay inconsequence. It seemed to Eve
that Richard's shoulders positively sagged with responsibility.</p>

<p>There was a dance at the club that night. Richard,
coming in, saw Eve in Pip's arms. They were
a graceful pair, and their steps matched perfectly.
Eve was all in white, wide-skirted, and her shoulders
and arms were bare. She had on gold slippers, and
her hair was gold. Richard had a sense of discomfort
as he watched them. He was going to marry
her, yet she was letting Pip look at her like that.
His cheeks burned. What was Pip saying? Was
he making love to Eve?</p>

<p>He had tried to meet the situation with dignity.
Yet there was no dignity in Eve's willingness to let
Pip follow her. To speak of it would, however, seem
to crystallize his feeling into a complaint.</p>

<p>Hence when he danced with her later, he tried to
respond to the lightness and brightness of her mood.
He tried to measure up to all the requirements of
his position as an engaged man and as a lover.
But he did not find it easy.</p>

<p>When he reached home that night, he found little
Fran&ccedil;ois awake, and ready to ask questions about
the hunt.</p>

<p>"Do you think they will get him?" he challenged
Richard, coming in small pink pajamas to the door
of the young doctor's room.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353"></a>[<a href="./images/353.png">353</a>]</span>
"Get who?"</p>

<p>"Old Pete."</p>

<p>"He is too cunning."</p>

<p>"Will he come through here?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>"I shall stick my fingers in my ears and shut my
eyes. Are you going to ride with them?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You won't let them kill old Pete, will you?"</p>

<p>"Not if I can help it."</p>

<p>After that, the child was more content. But when
Richard was at last in bed, Fran&ccedil;ois came again
across the hall, and stood on the threshold in the
moonlight. "It would be dreadful if it was his last
night."</p>

<p>"Whose last night, Fran&ccedil;ois?" sleepily.</p>

<p>"Old Pete's."</p>

<p>"Don't worry. And you must go to bed, Fran&ccedil;ois."</p>

<p>Richard waked to a glorious morning and to the
hunt. Pink coats dotted the countryside. It seemed
as if half the world was on its way to the club.
Richard, as he mounted one of Pip's hunters, a
powerful bay, felt the thrill of it all, and when he
joined Eve and her party he found them in an uproarious
mood.</p>

<p>Presently over hills streamed a picturesque procession&mdash;the
hounds in the lead, the horses following
with riders whose pink blazed against the green of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354"></a>[<a href="./images/354.png">354</a>]</span>
the pines, against the blue of the river, against the
fainter blue of the skies above.</p>

<p>And oh, the music of it, the sound of the horn,
the bell-like baying, the thud of flying feet!</p>

<p>Then, ahead of them all, as the hounds broke into
full cry, a silent, swift shadow&mdash;the old fox, Pete!</p>

<p>At first he ran easily. He had done it so often.
He had thrown them off after a chase which had
stirred his blood. He would throw them off again.</p>

<p>In leisurely fashion he led them. As the morning
advanced, however, he found himself hard pushed.
He was driven from one stronghold to another.
Tireless, the hounds followed and followed, until at
last he knew himself weary, seeking sanctuary.</p>

<p>He came with confidence to Crossroads. Beyond
the garden was his den. Once within and the thing
would end.</p>

<p>Across the lawn he loped, and little Fran&ccedil;ois, anxious
at the window, spied him. "Will he get to it,
will he get to it?" he said to Nancy, his small face
white with the fear of what might happen, "and
when he gets there will he be safe?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she assured him; "and when they have
run him aground, they will ride away."</p>

<p>But they did not ride away. It happened that
those who were in the lead were unaware of the tradition
of the country, and so they began to dig him
out, this old king of foxes, who had felt himself secure
in his castle!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"></a>[<a href="./images/355.png">355</a>]</span>
They set the dogs at one end, and fetched mattocks
and spades from the stable.</p>

<p>Pip and Eve were among them. Pip directing,
Eve mad with the excitement of it all.</p>

<p>Little Fran&ccedil;ois, watching, clung to Nancy. "Oh,
they can't, they mustn't!"</p>

<p>She soothed him, and at last sent Milly out, but
they would not listen.</p>

<p>Nancy and Sulie were as white now as little Fran&ccedil;ois.
"Oh, where is Richard?" Nancy said. "It
is like murder to do a thing like that. It is bad
enough in the open&mdash;but like a rat&mdash;in a trap."</p>

<p>The big bay was charging down the hill with
Richard yelling at the top of his voice. The bay
had proved troublesome and had bolted in the
wrong direction, but Richard had brought him back
to Crossroads just in time!</p>

<p>Fran&ccedil;ois screamed. "It is Dr. Dicky. He'll
make them stop. He'll make them."</p>

<p>He did make them. His voice rang sharply.
"Get the dogs away, Meade, and stop digging."</p>

<p>They were too eager at first to heed him. Eve
hung on his arm, but he shook her off. "We don't
like things like that down here. Our foxes are too
rare."</p>

<p>It was a motley group which gathered later at the
club for the hunt breakfast. There were fox-hunting
farmers born on the land, of sturdy yeoman stock,
and careless of form. There were the lords of newly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356"></a>[<a href="./images/356.png">356</a>]</span>
acquired acres, who rode carefully on little saddles
with short stirrups in the English style.</p>

<p>There were the descendants of the great old planters,
daring, immensely picturesque. There was
Eve's crowd, trained for the sport, and at their ease.</p>

<p>A big fire burned on the hearth. A copper-covered
table held steaming dishes. Another table
groaned under its load of cold meats and cheese.
On an ancient mahogany sideboard were various
bottles and bowls of punch.</p>

<p>Old songs were sung and old stories told. Brinsley
beamed on everybody with his face like a round
full moon. There were other round and red-faced
gentlemen who, warmed by the fire and the punch,
twinkled like unsteady old stars.</p>

<p>Eve was the pivotal center of all the hilarity. She
sat on the table and served the punch. Her coat
was off, and in her silk blouse and riding breeches
she was like a lovely boy. The men crowded around
her. Pip, always at her elbow, delivered an admiring
opinion. "No one can hold a candle to you, Eve."</p>

<p>Richard was out of it. He sat quietly in a corner
with David, old Jo at their feet, and watched the
others. Eve had been angry with him for his interference
at Crossroads. "I didn't know you were a
molly-coddle, Dicky," she had said, "and I wanted
the brush."</p>

<p>She was punishing him now by paying absolutely
no attention to him. She was punishing him, too,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"></a>[<a href="./images/357.png">357</a>]</span>
by making herself conspicuous, which she knew he
hated. The scene was not to his liking. The
women of his household, Nancy, Sulie and Anne,
had had a fastidious sense of what belonged to them
as ladies. Eve had not that sense. As he sat there,
it occurred to him that things were moving to some
stupendous climax. He and Eve couldn't go on
like this.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Far up in the hills a man was in danger of bleeding
to death. He had cut himself while butchering
a pig. The doctor was called.</p>

<p>Richard, making his way through the shouting
and singing crowd which surrounded Eve, told her,
"I shall have to go for a little while. There's a man
hurt. I'll be back in an hour."</p>

<p>She looked down at him with hard eyes. "We
are going to ride cross-country&mdash;to the Ridge. You
might meet us there, if you care to come."</p>

<p>"You know I care."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure. You don't show it. I&mdash;I am tired
of never having a lover&mdash;Dicky."</p>

<p>It was a wonderful afternoon. The heavy frost
had chilled the air, the leaves were red, and the sky
was blue&mdash;and there was green and brown and gold.
But Richard as he rode up in the hills had no eyes
for the color, no ears for the song beaten out by big
Ben's hoofs. The vision which held him was of Eve
in the midst of that shouting circle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358"></a>[<a href="./images/358.png">358</a>]</span>
The man who had cut himself was black. He was
thin and tall and his hair was gray. He had worked
hard all of his life, but he had never worked out of
himself the spirit of joyous optimism.</p>

<p>"I jes' tole 'um," he said, "to send for Dr. Brooks,
and he'd beat the devil gettin' to me."</p>

<p>When Richard reached the Ridge, a flash of scarlet
at once caught his eye. On the slope below Eve,
far ahead of Meade, in a mad race, was making for
a grove at the edge of the Crossroads boundaries.
She was a reckless rider, and Richard held his breath
as she took fences, leaped hurdles, and cleared the
flat wide stream.</p>

<p>As she came to the grove she turned and waved
triumphantly to Pip. For a moment she made a
vivid and brilliant figure in her scarlet against the
green. Then the little wood swallowed her up.</p>

<p>Pip came pounding after, and Richard, spurring
his big Ben to unaccustomed efforts, circled the grove
to meet them on the other side.</p>

<p>But they did not come. From the point where he
finally drew up he could command a view of both
sides of the slope. Unless they had turned back,
they were still in the grove.</p>

<p>Then out of the woods came Pip, running. He
had something in his arms.</p>

<p>"It is Eve," he said, panting; "there was a hole
and her horse stumbled. I found her."</p>

<p>Poor honest Pip! As if she were his own, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"></a>[<a href="./images/359.png">359</a>]</span>
held her now in his arms. Her golden head, swung
up to his shoulder, rested heavily above his heart.
Her eyes were shut.</p>

<p>Richard's practiced eye saw at once her state of
collapse. He jumped from his horse. "Give her to
me, Meade," he said, "and get somebody's car as
quickly as you can."</p>

<p>And now the tiger in Pip flashed out. "She's
mine," he said, breathing hoarsely. "I love her.
You go and get the car."</p>

<p>"Man," the young doctor said steadily, "this isn't
the time to quarrel. Lay her down, then, and let
me have a look at her."</p>

<p>He had his little case of medicines, and he hunted
for something to bring her back to consciousness.
Pip, pale and shaken, folded his coat under her
head and chafed her hands.</p>

<p>Presently life seemed to sweep through her body.
She shivered and moved.</p>

<p>Her eyes came open. "What happened?"</p>

<p>"You fell from your horse. Meade found you."</p>

<p>There were no bones broken, but the shock had
been great. She lay very still and white against
Pip's arm.</p>

<p>Richard closed his medicine case and rose. He
stood looking down at her.</p>

<p>"Better, old lady?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Dicky."</p>

<p>He spoke a little awkwardly. "I'll ride down if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360"></a>[<a href="./images/360.png">360</a>]</span>
you don't mind, and come back for you in Meade's
car." His eyes did not meet hers.</p>

<p>As he plunged over the hill on his heavy old horse,
her puzzled gaze followed him. Then she gave a
queer little laugh. "Is he running away from me,
Pip?"</p>

<p>"I told him you were&mdash;mine," the big man burst
out.</p>

<p>"You told him? Oh, Pip, what did he say?"</p>

<p>"That this was not the time to talk about it."</p>

<p>She lay very still thinking it out. Then she
turned on his arm. "Good old Pip," she said. He
drew her up to him, and she said it again, with that
queer little laugh, "Good old Pip, you're the best
ever. And all this time I have been looking straight
over your blessed old head at&mdash;Dicky."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3><i>In Which St. Michael Finds Love in a Garden.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> flowers in Marie-Louise's bowl were lilacs.
And Marie-Louise, sitting up in bed, writing
verses, was in pale mauve. Her windows were wide
open, and the air from the river, laden with fragrance,
swept through the room.</p>

<p>The big house had been closed all winter. Austin
had elected to spend the season in Florida, and had
taken all of his household with him, including Anne.
He had definitely retired from practice when Richard
left him. "I can't carry it on alone, and I don't
want to break in anybody else," he had said, and
had turned the whole thing over to one of his colleagues.</p>

<p>But April had brought him back to "Rose Acres"
in time for the lilacs, and Marie-Louise, uplifted by
the fact that Geoffrey Fox was at that very moment
finishing his book in the balcony room, had decided
that lilacs in the silver bowl should express the ecstatic
state of her mind.</p>

<p>Anne, coming in at noon, asked, "What are you
writing?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a>[<a href="./images/362.png">362</a>]</span>
"<i>Vers libre.</i> This is called, 'To Dr. Dicky, Dinging.'"</p>

<p>"What a subject, and you call it poetry?"</p>

<p>"Why not? Isn't he coming to dinner for the
first time since&mdash;he left New York, and since he
broke off with Eve, and since&mdash;a lot of other things&mdash;and
isn't it an important occasion, Mistress Anne?"</p>

<p>Anne ignored the question. "What have you
written?"</p>

<p>"Only the outline. He comes&mdash;has caviar, and
his eyes are on the queen. He drinks his soup&mdash;and
dreams. He has fish&mdash;and a vision of the future;
rhapsodies with the roast," she twinkled; "do
you like it?"</p>

<p>"As far as it goes."</p>

<p>"It goes very far, and you know it. And you are
blushing."</p>

<p>"I am not."</p>

<p>"You are. Look in the glass. Mistress Anne,
aren't you glad that Eve is married?"</p>

<p>"Yes," honestly, "and that she is happy."</p>

<p>"Pip was made for her. I loved him at Palm
Beach, adoring her, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Anne's mind went back to it. The marriage
had followed immediately upon the announcement
of the broken engagement. People had pitied
poor young Dr. Brooks. But Anne had not. One
does not pity a man who, having been bound, is
free.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"></a>[<a href="./images/363.png">363</a>]</span>
He had written to her a half dozen times during
the winter, friendly letters with news of Crossroads,
and now that she was again at Rose Acres, he was
coming up.</p>

<p>The spring day was bright. Rich with possibilities.
"Marie-Louise, don't stay in bed. Nobody
has a right to be in the house on such a day as
this."</p>

<p>But Marie-Louise wouldn't be moved. "I want
to finish my verses."</p>

<p>So Anne went out alone into the garden. It was
ablaze with spring bloom, the river was blue, and
Pan piped on his reeds. Geoffrey waved to her
from his balcony. She waved back, then went for a
walk alone. She returned to have tea on the terrace.
The day seemed interminable. The hour for
dinner astonishingly remote.</p>

<p>At last, however, it was time to dress. The gown
that she chose was of pale rose, heavily weighted
with silver. It hung straight and slim. Her slippers
were of silver, and she still wore her dark hair
in the smooth swept-up fashion which so well became
her.</p>

<p>Richard, seeing her approach down the length of
the big drawing-room where he stood with Austin,
was conscious of a sense of shock. It was as if he
had expected that she would come to him in her old
blue serge, or in the little white gown with the many
ruffles. That she came in such elegance made her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364"></a>[<a href="./images/364.png">364</a>]</span>
seem&mdash;alien. Like Eve. Oh, where was the Anne
of yesterday?</p>

<p>Even when she spoke to him, when her hand was
in his, when she walked beside him on the way to
the dining-room, he had this sense of strangeness,
as if the girl in rose-color was not the girl of whom
he had dreamed through all the days since he had
known that he was not to marry Eve.</p>

<p>The winter had been a busy one for him, but satisfying
in the sense that he was at last in his rightful
place. He had come into his own. He had no
more doubts that his work was wisely chosen. But
his life was as yet unfinished. To complete it, he
had felt that he must round out his days with the
woman he loved.</p>

<p>But now that he was here, he saw her fitted to her
new surroundings as a jewel fitted to a golden setting.
And she liked lovely things, she liked excitement,
and the nearness of the great metropolis.
There were men who had wanted to marry her.
Marie-Louise had told him that in a gay little letter
which she had sent from the South.</p>

<p>As he reviewed it now disconsolately, he reminded
himself that he had never had any real reason to
know that Anne cared for him. There had been a
flash of the eye, a few grave words, a break in her
voice, his answered letters; but a woman might dole
out these small favors to a friend.</p>

<p>Thus from caviar to soup, and from soup to roast,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365"></a>[<a href="./images/365.png">365</a>]</span>
he contradicted Marie-Louise's conception of his
state of mind. Fear and doubt, discouragement, a
touch of despair, these carried him as far as the salad.</p>

<p>And then he heard Austin's voice speaking. "So
you are really contented at Crossroads, Brooks?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I wish you would come down and let me
show you some of the things I am doing. A bit
primitive, perhaps, in the light of your larger experience.
But none the less effective, and interesting."</p>

<p>Austin shrugged. "I can't imagine anything but
martyrdom in such a life&mdash;for me. What do you
do with yourself when you are not working&mdash;with
no theaters&mdash;opera&mdash;restaurants&mdash;excitements?"</p>

<p>"We get along rather well without them&mdash;except
for an occasional trip to town."</p>

<p>"But you need such things," dogmatically; "a
man can't live out of the world and not&mdash;degenerate."</p>

<p>"He may live in it, and degenerate." Anne was
speaking. Her cheeks were as pink as her gown.
She leaned a little forward. "You don't know all
that they have at Crossroads, and Dr. Brooks is too
polite to tell you how poor New York seems to those
of us who&mdash;know."</p>

<p>"Poor?" Richard had turned to her, his face
illumined.</p>

<p>"Isn't it? Think of the things you have that
New York doesn't know of. A singing river&mdash;this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366"></a>[<a href="./images/366.png">366</a>]</span>
river doesn't sing, or if it does nobody would have
time to listen. And Crossroads has a bell on its
school that calls to the countryside. City children

alike&mdash;they ride on trolleys and watch the clocks.
My little pupils ran across the fields and down the
road, and hurried when I rang for them, and came
in&mdash;rosy."</p>

<p>She was rosy herself as she recounted it.</p>

<p>"Oh, we have a lot of things&mdash;the bridge with the
lights&mdash;and the road up to the Ridge&mdash;and Diogenes.
Dr. Austin, you should see Diogenes."</p>

<p>She laughed, and they all laughed with her, but
back of Richard's laugh there was an emotion which
swept him on and up to heights beyond anything
that he had ever hoped or dreamed.</p>

<p>After that, he could hardly wait for the ending of
the dinner, hardly wait to get away from them all,
and out under the stars.</p>

<p>It was when they were at last alone on the steps
above the fountain, with the garden pouring all of
its fragrance down upon them, that he said, "I
should not have dared ask it if you had not said
what you said."</p>

<p>"Oh, St. Michael, St. Michael," she whispered,
"where was your courage?"</p>

<p>"But in this gown, this lovely gown, you didn't
look like anything that I could&mdash;have. I am only a
country doctor, Anne."</p>

"Only my beloved&mdash;Richard."</p>

<p>They clung together, these two who had found
Love in the garden. But they had found more than
Love. They had found the meaning for all that
Richard had done, and for all that Anne would do.
And that which they had found they would never
give up!</p>

<p class="center">May be had wherever books are sold.&ensp;&ensp;Ask for Grosset and Dunlap's list.</p>

<p><b>THE MAN WITHOUT A HEART</b></p>

<p>&ensp;&ensp;Why was Barbara held captive in a deserted hermit's hut for days by a "man
without a heart" and in the end how was it that she held the winning cards.</p>

<p><b>THE ROMANCE OF A ROGUE</b></p>

<p>&ensp;&ensp;Twenty-four hours after his release from prison Bruce Lawn finds himself playing
a most surprising role in a drama of human relationships that sweeps on to a
wonderfully emotional climax.</p>

<p><b>THE MATHERSON MARRIAGE</b></p>

<p>&ensp;&ensp;She married for money. With her own hands she had locked the door on happiness
and thrown away the key. But read the story which is very interesting and
well told.</p>

<p><b>RICHARD CHATTERTON</b></p>

<p>&ensp;&ensp;A fascinating story in which love and jealousy play strange tricks with women's
souls.</p>

<p><b>A BACHELOR HUSBAND</b></p>

<p>&ensp;&ensp;Can a woman love two men at the same time?</p>

<p>&ensp;&ensp;In its solving of this particular variety of triangle "A Bachelor Husband" will
particularly interest, and strangely enough, without one shock to the most conventional
minded.</p>

<p><b>THE SCAR</b></p>

<p>&ensp;&ensp;With fine comprehension and insight the author shows a terrific contrast between
the woman whose love was of the flesh and one whose love was of the spirit.</p>

<p><b>THE MARRIAGE OF BARRY WICKLOW</b></p>

<p>&ensp;&ensp;Here is a man and woman who, marrying for love, yet try to build their wedded
life upon a gospel of hate for each other and yet win back to a greater love for each
other in the end.</p>

<p><b>THE UPHILL ROAD</b></p>

<p>&ensp;&ensp;The heroine of this story was a consort of thieves. The man was fine, clean,
fresh from the West. It is a story of strength and passion.</p>

<p><b>WINDS OF THE WORLD</b></p>

<p>&ensp;&ensp;Jill, a poor little typist, marries the great Henry Sturgess and inherits millions,
but not happiness. Then at last&mdash;but we must leave that to Ruby M. Ayres to tell
you as only she can.</p>

<p><b>THE SECOND HONEYMOON</b></p>

<p>&ensp;&ensp;In this story the author has produced a book which no one who has loved or
hopes to love can afford to miss. The story fairly leaps from climax to climax.</p>

<p><b>THE PHANTOM LOVER</b></p>

<p>&ensp;&ensp;Have you not often heard of someone being in love with love rather than the
person they believed the object of their affections? That was Esther! But she
passes through the crisis into a deep and profound love.</p>

to first choice of rich lands on an Indian reservation in Wyoming. It
meant a fortune; but before he established his ownership he had a
hard battle with crooks and politicians.</p>

<p><b>THE DUKE OF CHIMNEY BUTTE</b></p>

<p>&ensp;&ensp;When Jerry Lambert, "the Duke," attempts to safeguard the
cattle ranch of Vesta Philbrook from thieving neighbors, his work is
appallingly handicapped because of Grace Kerr, one of the chief agitators,
and a deadly enemy of Vesta's. A stirring tale of brave deeds,
gun-play and a love that shines above all.</p>

<p><b>THE FLOCKMASTER OF POISON CREEK</b></p>

<p>&ensp;&ensp;John Mackenzie trod the trail from Jasper to the great sheep
country where fortunes were being made by the flock-masters.
Shepherding was not a peaceful pursuit in those bygone days. Adventure
met him at every turn&mdash;there is a girl of course&mdash;men fight
their best fights for a woman&mdash;it is an epic of the sheeplands.</p>

<p><b>THE LAND OF LAST CHANCE</b></p>

<p>&ensp;&ensp;Jim Timberlake and Capt. David Scott waited with restless
thousands on the Oklahoma line for the signal to dash across the
border. How the city of Victory arose overnight on the plains, how
people savagely defended their claims against the "sooners;" how
good men and bad played politics, makes a strong story of growth
and American initiative.</p>

<p><b>TRAIL'S END</b></p>

<p>&ensp;&ensp;Ascalon was the end of the trail for thirsty cowboys who gave
vent to their pent-up feelings without restraint. Calvin Morgan was
not concerned with its wickedness until Seth Craddock's malevolence
directed itself against him. He did not emerge from the maelstrom
until he had obliterated every vestige of lawlessness, and assured
himself of the safety of a certain dark-eyed girl.</p>
